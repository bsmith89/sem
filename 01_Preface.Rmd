# Preface

<span style="font-variant:small-caps; font-size:150%"></span>This document originally served as the basis for a workshop held over a couple of afternoons.  However, it is now more or less a document on graphical/latent variable modeling more generally. Much, if not most, of it may not be covered in the workshop in detail, and may continue to be expanded upon over time. 

When first encountering these models, it may depend on one's discipline how such models may be presented.  The following will take a broad view initially, but then focus on what is  referred to as <span class="emph">*structural equation modeling*</span>, especially as depicted in social science and educational literature, but definitely *not* limited to those.  An attempt will be made to use a consistent, rather than discipline specific nomenclature and approach. 

One of the goals of this set of notes is to *not* impart a false sense of comfort and/or familiarity with the techniques. No one is going to be an expert after a couple of afternoons with SEM.  SEM and related techniques are typically taught over the course of a few weeks in a traditional applied statistics course, or given their own course outright.  Instead, one of the primary goals here is to instill a firm conceptual foundation starting with common approaches (e.g. standard regression), while exposing the participant to a wide family of related techniques, any of which might be useful to one's modeling and data situation, but may or may not traditionally fall under the heading of traditional SEM topics.


## Prerequisites 

The following prerequisites are more for those attending the workshop.  While they would apply to anyone attempting to learn SEM, I encourage anyone to read through the notes on their own, though these should give you a sense of what knowledge/skill is assumed.

### Statistical

One should at least have a *firm* understanding of standard regression modeling techniques. If you are new to statistical analysis in general, I'll be blunt and say you are probably not ready for SEM.  SEM employs knowledge of maximum likelihood, multivariate analysis, measurement error, indirect effects etc., and none of this is typically covered in a first semester of statistics in many applied disciplines.  SEM builds upon that basic regression foundation, and if that is not solid, SEM will probably be confusing and/or magical at best.  

### Programming

SEM requires its own modeling language approach.  As such, the syntax for Mplus and SEM specific programs, as well as SEM models within other languages or programs (e.g. R or Stata) are going to require you to learn something new.  If you are not familiar with R, you'll want to go through the R introduction to get oriented, but there are many intros on the web to get you started with more detail.
