# Preface

<span style="font-variant:small-caps; font-size:150%"></span>This document originally served as the basis for a workshop held over a couple of afternoons.  However, it is now more or less a document on graphical/latent variable modeling more generally. Much, if not most, of it may not be covered in the workshop in detail, and may continue to be expanded upon over time. 

When first encountering these models, it may depend on one's discipline how such models may be presented.  The following will take a broad view initially, but then focus on what is  referred to as <span class="emph">*structural equation modeling*</span> in the social and educational science literature.  An attempt will be made to use a consistent, rather than discipline specific nomenclature and approach. 

One of the goals of this set of notes is to *not* instill a false sense of comfort and/or familiarity with the techniques. No one is going to be an expert after a couple of afternoons with SEM.  SEM and other techniques covered are typically taught over the course of a few weeks in a traditional statistics course, or given their own course outright.  Instead, one of the primary goals here is to instill a firm conceptual foundation starting with common approaches (e.g. standard regression), while exposing the participant to a wide family of related techniques, any of which might be useful to one's modeling and data situation, but may or may not traditionally fall under the heading of traditional SEM topics.


## Prerequisites 

The following prerequisites are more for those attending the workshop.  While they would apply to anyone attempting to learn SEM, I encourage anyone to read through the notes on their own, though these should give you a sense of what knowledge/skill is assumed.

### Statistical

One should at least have a *firm* understanding of standard regression modeling techniques. If you are new to statistical analysis in general, I'll be blunt and say you are probably not ready for SEM.  SEM employs knowledge of maximum likelihood, multivariate analysis, measurement error, indirect effects etc., and none of this is typically covered in a first semester of statistics in many applied disciplines.  SEM builds upon that basic regression foundation, and if that is not solid, SEM will probably be confusing and/or magical at best.  

### Programming

SEM requires its own modeling language approach.  As such, the syntax for Mplus and SEM specific programs, as well as SEM models within other languages or programs (e.g. R or Stata) are going to require you to learn something new.  If you are not familiar with R, you'll want to go through the R introduction to get oriented, but there are many intros on the web to get you started in more detail.

# Introduction 

## Outline

### Graphical Models

The document will start with the familiar, a standard regression model.  It will then be presented as a <span class="emph">graphical model</span>, and extended to include indirect effects (e.g. $\mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{C}$) and multiple outcomes.  At this point we will discuss *directed graphs*, and demonstrate a more theoretically motivated approach (sometimes called *path analysis*), and compare it to a more flexible approach (Bayesian network) that does not require prespecification of paths nor specific directional relations.  At this point, we'll briefly discuss undirected graphs, with an example utilizing 'network analysis', though any exercise will likely be left to the participant's own time.

### Latent Variables

We will then discuss the notion of <span class="emph">latent variables</span> in the context of *underlying causes or constructs* and  **measurement error**.  We will also note that latent variable models are actually even more broadly utilized when one includes other *dimension reduction*, or *data compression*, techniques, several of which fall under the heading of *factor analysis*.  A few common techniques will be demonstrated such as 'factor analysis' and principal components analysis, and an overview will be provided for others. In addition, we will briefly discuss the relation of latent variable models to random effects models (something that will be demonstrated in more detail later), and note other places one might find latent variables (e.g. the EM algorithm, hidden Markov models).


### SEM

Next we turn to <span class="emph">structural equation modeling</span>, where previously covered models come together under one modeling approach.  We will spend a good deal of time with measurement models first, comparing them to our previous efforts, and then extend those models to the case of regression with latent variables.  There are many issues to consider when developing such models, and an attempt will be made to cover quite a bit of ground in that regard.  


### Others

Other topics are touched upon for reference, and may be added to in the future. For example <span class="emph">latent growth curve</span> models, are an alternative to a standard mixed model. Also, there are situations where the latent variable might be considered categorical, commonly called <span class="emph">mixture models</span> or cluster analysis, but in some specific contexts might go by other names (e.g. latent class analysis).  Finally, an overview of other types of latent variable or structural equation models, such as item response theory, collaborative filtering etc. may also be provided.


## Programming Language Choice

<img src="img/Rlogo.svg" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; width:50%">

We will use **<span class='pack'>R</span>** for a variety of reasons.  One is that all of the techniques mentioned thus far are fully developed within various R packages, often taking just a line or two of code to implement after the data has been prepped.  Furthermore, it is freely available and will work on Windows, Mac and Linux.  R is well-known as a powerful statistical modeling environment, and its flexible programming language allows for efficient data manipulation and exploration.  Furthermore, it has a vast array of visualization capabilities.  In short, it provides everything one might need in a single environment.


Among alternatives, MPlus is the most fully developed structural equation modeling package, and has been for years.  However, it is a poor tool for data management, few universities have a campus-wide license for it, and most of its functionality (and all we will need for this our purposes) is implemented within the <span class='pack'>lavaan</span> family of R packages.  Stata has recently provided SEM capabilities, but it is less well-developed (something that might change in time), and it still requires a license, making non-campus usage difficult or costly.  SPSS Amos would perhaps be another alternative for some, but suffers the same licensing issues and is not as flexible as MPlus. Historically it has lagged far behind MPlus in capabilities, and furthermore it is not supported for Unix operating systems such as Mac and Linux.  Other alternatives include Proc Calis in SAS and OpenMX (another R package).  Python implementation seems minimal presently.  Historically, people used EQS and LISREL, but the former is no longer developed and the latter is no longer relatively widely used, as well as being a Windows-only application.


## Setup

For those wishing to follow along, for things to go smoothly you'll need to complete the following steps *precisely*.  

If you are not present or are bringing your laptop, you'll need to have both R and RStudio installed on whatever machine you'll be using.  If this will be a new experience for you, [install R first](https://cloud.r-project.org/), then [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).  For either you'll need to choose the version appropriate to your operating system.  As you go through the installation, for both just accept all defaults when prompted until the installation process begins.  Once both are installed, *you will only need to work with RStudio*, and it will at all times be assumed you will be using RStudio during the workshop.

Once those are installed, proceed through the following steps.

1. Download this [zipfile](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~micl/sem/workshop_files.zip), and unzip its contents to an area on your machine that you have write access to. It contains the course contents, data, etc. in a folder that will serve as an RStudio project folder.

2. Open RStudio.  File/Open Project/ then navigate to the folder contents you just unzipped.  Click on the SEM file (should look like a blue icon, but otherwise is the SEM.Rproj file).

3. If the file is not already opened after opening the RStudio project, File/Open File/my_code.R . Run the one line of code there and you're set.

The lab for the workshop has Windows machines, and so the above is enough to proceed. For *nix systems, it's probably easiest to just install the packages as we use them.

# Introduction to R 

This introduction to R is very brief and only geared toward providing some basics so that one can understand and run the code associated with the content.  It is geared toward an audience that likely has no programming experience whatsoever, but may have had some exposure to traditional statistics packages.  If you have some basic familiarity with R you may skip this chapter, though it might serve as a refresher for some.


## Getting Started


### Installation

As mentioned previously, to begin with R for your own machine, you just need to go to the [R website](https://www.r-project.org/), download it for your operating system, and install. Then go to [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), download and install it.  From there on you only need RStudio to use R.  

Updates occur every few months, and you should update R whenever a new version is released.


### Packages

As soon as you install it, R is already the most powerful statistical environment within which to work. However, its real strength comes from the community, which has added thousands of <span class="emph">packages</span> that provide additional or enhanced functionality.  You will regularly find packages that specifically do something you want, and will need to install them in order to use them.

RStudio provides a **Packages** tab, but it is usually just as or more efficient to use the <span class="func">install.packages</span> function.

<img src="img/packagesTab.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;">

```{r installpackage, eval=F}
install.packages('mynewfavorite')
```


At this point there are over 7000 packages available through standard sources, and many more through unofficial ones.  To start getting some ideas of what you want to use, you will want to spend time at places like [CRAN Task Views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/), [Rdocumentation](http://www.rdocumentation.org/), or with a list [like this one](https://github.com/qinwf/awesome-R).

The main thing to note is that if you want to use a package, you have to load it with the <span class="func">library</span> function.

```{r loadPackage, eval=FALSE}
library(lazerhawk)
```

Sometimes, you only need the package for one thing and there is no reason to keep it loaded, in which case you can use the following approach.

```{r packageoneoff, eval=FALSE}
packagename::packagefunction(args)
```

I suggest using the <span class="func">library</span> function for newbies.

You'll get the hang of finding, installing, and using packages quite quickly. However, note that the increasing popularity and ease of using R means that packages can vary quite a bit in terms of quality, so you may need to try out a couple packages with seemingly similar functionality to find the best for your situation.


### RStudio

RStudio is an <span class="emph">integrated development environment</span> (**IDE**) specifically geared toward R (though it works for other languages too).  At the very least it will make your programming far easier and more efficient, at best you can create publish-ready documents, manage projects, create interactive website regarding your research, use version control, and much more. I have an overview [here](https://m-clark.github.io/docs/introRStudio.html).

See [Emacs Speaks Statistics](http://ess.r-project.org/) for an alternative. The point is, base R is not an efficient way to use R, and you have at least two very powerful options to make your coding experience easier and more efficient.



## Key things to know about R


### R is a programming language, not a 'stats package'

The first thing to note for those new to R is that R is a language that is oriented toward, but not specific to, dealing with statistics.  This means it's highly flexible, but does take some getting used to.  If you go in with a spreadsheet style mindset, you'll have difficulty, as well as miss out on the power it has to offer.


### Never ask if R can do what you want.  It can.

The only limitation to R is the user's programming sophistication. The better you get at statistical programming the further you can explore your data and take your research.  This holds for any statistical endeavor whether using R or not.


### Main components: script, console, graphics device

With R, the *script* is where you write your R code. While you could do everything at the console, this would be difficult at best and unreproducible.  The *console* is where the results are produced from running the script.  Again you can do one-liner stuff there, such as getting help for a function.  The *graphics device* is where visualizations are produced, and in RStudio you have two, one for static plots, and a **viewer** for potentially interactive ones.


### R is easy to use, but difficult to master.

If you only want to use R in an applied fashion, as we will do here, R can be very easy to use.  As an example the following code would read in data and run a regression.

```{r Reasy, eval=F}
mydata = read.csv(file='location/myfile.csv')
regModel = lm(y ~ x, data=mydata)
summary(regModel)
```

The above code demonstrates that R can be as easy to use as anything else, and in my opinion, it is for any standard analysis.  The nice part is that it can still be *easier* to use with more complex analyses you either won't find elsewhere or will only get with crippled functionality.


### Object-oriented

This section may be a little more than newcome to R wants or even needs to know to get started with R. However, most of the newbie's errors will be due not knowing a little about this aspect of R programming, and I've seen some make the same mistakes even after using R for a long time as a result.


R is <span class="emph">object-oriented</span>.  For our purposes this means that we create what are called objects and use <span class="emph">functions</span> to manipulate those objects in some fashion. In the above code we created two objects, an object that held the data and an object that held the regression results.  

Objects can be ***anything***, a character string, a list of 1000 data sets, the results of an analysis, ***anything***.

#### Assignment

In order to create an object, we must <span class="emph">assign</span> something to it.  You'll come across two ways to do this.

```{r assign, eval=F}
myObject = something
myObject <- something
```

These result in the same thing, an object called <span class="objclass">myObject</span> that contains 'something' in it. For all appropriate practical use, which you use is a matter of personal preference. The point is that typical practice in R entails that one assigns something to an object and then uses functions on that object to get something more from it.

#### Functions

Functions are objects that take input of various kinds and produce some output (simply called a *value*).  In the above code we used three functions: <span class="func">read.csv</span>, <span class="func">lm</span>, and <span class="func">summary</span>.  Functions (usually) come with named <span class="emph">arguments</span>, that note what types of inputs the function can take.  With <span class="func">read.csv</span>, we merely gave it one argument the file name, but there are actually a couple dozen, each with some default.  Type `?read.csv` at the console to see the helpfile.

#### Classes

All objects have a certain class, which means that some functions will work in certain ways depending on the class.  Consider the following code.

```{r classDemo}
x = rnorm(100)
y = x + rnorm(100)
mod = lm(y ~ x)
summary(x)
summary(mod)
```

In both cases we used the `summary` function, but get different results.  There are two <span class="emph">methods</span> for summary at work here: <span class="">summary.default</span> and <span class="">summary.lm</span>.  Which is used depends on the class of the object given as an argument to the summary function.  Most of the time however, there are unique functions that will only work on one class of object.

```{r classDemo2}
class(x)
class(mod)
```

One of the most common classes of objects used is the <span class="objclass">data.frame</span>.  Data frames are matrices that contain multiple types of vectors that are the variables and observations of interest.  The contents can be numeric, factors (categorical variables), character strings and other types of objects.  

```{r dataframeDemo}
nams = c('Bob Ross', 'Bob Marley', 'Bob Odenkirk')
places = c('Dirt', 'Dirt', 'New Mexico')
yod = c(1995, 1981, 2028)

bobs = data.frame(nams, places, yod)
bobs
```


### Case sensitive

A great deal of the errors you will get when you start learning R will result from not typing something correctly.  For example, what if we try `summary(X)`?

```{r error, error=TRUE}
summary(X)
```

Errors are merely messages or calls for help from R. It can't do what you ask and needs something else in order to perform the task.  In this case, R is telling you it can't find anything called X, which makes sense because the object name is lowercase $x$.  This error message is somewhat straightforward, but error messages for all programming languages typically aren't, and depending on what you're trying to do, it may be fairly vague.  If you get an error, your first thought as you start out with R should be to check the names of things.

### The lavaan package

You'll see more later, but in order to use lavaan for structural equation modeling, you'll need two things primarily: an object that represents the **data**, and an object that represents the **model**. It will look something like the following.

```{r lavaanExample0, eval=FALSE}
modelCode = "
  y ~ x1 + x2 + lv            # structural/regression model
  lv =~ z1 + z2 + z3 + z4     # measurement model with latent variable lv
"

library(lavaan)
mymodel = sem(modelCode, data=mydata)
```

The character string is our model, and it can actually be kept as a separate file (without the assignment) if desired. Using the <span class="pack">lavaan</span> library, we can then use one of its specific functions like <span class="func">cfa</span>, <span class="func">sem</span>, or <span class="func">growth</span> to use the model code object (<span class="objclass">modelCode</span> above) and the data object (<span class="objclass">mydata</span> above).


The way to define things in lavaan can be summarized as follows.
```{r lavanCodeTable, echo=FALSE}
formulaType = c('latent variable definition', 'regression', '(residual) (co)variance', 'intercept', 'fixed parameter')
operator = c('=~', '~', '~~', '~ 1', '_*')
mnemonic = c('is measured by', 'is regressed on', 'is correlated with', 'intercept', 'is fixed at the value of _')
pander::pander(data.frame(formulaType, operator, mnemonic))
```

### Getting help
Use `?` to get the helpfile for a specific function, or `??` to do a search, possibly on a quoted phrase.

Examples:

```{r gethelp, eval=FALSE}
?lm
??regression
??'nonlinear regression'
```



## Moving forward

Hopefully you'll get the hang of things as we run the code in later chapters.  You'll essentially only be asked to tweak code that's already provided.  This document (and associated workshop) is not the place to learn R.  However, here are some exercises to make sure we start to get comfortable with it.

### Exercises

Interactive version [here](exercise_introR.html)

1. Create an object that consists of the numbers one through five.
using `c(1,2,3,4,5)` or `1:5`

2. Create a different object, that is the same as that object, but plus 1 (i.e. the numbers two through six).

3. Without creating an object, use <span class="func">cbind</span> and <span class="func">rbind</span>, feeding your objects as arguments. For example `cbind(obj1, obj2)`.

4. Create a new object using <span class="objclass">data.frame</span> just as you did <span class="func">rbind</span> or <span class="func">cbind</span> in #3.

5. Inspect the class of the object, and use the <span class="func">summary</span> function on it.

### Summary

There's a lot to learn with R, and the more time you spend with R the easier your research process will likely go, and the more you will learn about statistical analysis.

# Graphical Models

```{r setupGM, include=FALSE}
knitr::clean_cache()
library(lavaan); library(DiagrammeR); library(bnlearn); library(visNetwork); library(igraph) # only load mediation as needed
```

A graphical model can be seen as a mathematical or statistical construct connecting *nodes* (or vertices) via *edges* (or links).  When pertaining to statistical models, the nodes might represent variables of interest in our data set, and edges specify the relationships among them.  Visually they are depicted in the style of the following examples.


<img src="img/graphicalModels.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; width:50%">

```{r graphVizExample, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
DiagrammeR("
digraph DAG {
  # Intialization of graph attributes
  graph [overlap = false]

  # Initialization of node attributes
  node [shape = circle,
        fontname = Helvetica,
        color = gray80,
        type = box,
        fixedsize = true]

  # Initialization of edge attributes
  edge [color = gray25, rel = yields]

  # Node statements
  X; Y; Z; ☺;  1; 2; 3;

  node [fontcolor = 'darkred']
  ♥; ☻;

  # Edge statements
  X -> Y; Z -> Y;
  ☺ -> ♥; ♥ -> ☻; ☺->☻;

  # Initialization of edge attributes
  edge [color = gray25, rel = yields, arrowhead=none]
  1 -> 2; 2 -> 3; 1 -> 3;
}
", type='grViz')

```


Any statistical model you've conducted can be expressed as a graphical model.  As an example, the first graph with nodes X, Y, and Z might represent a regression model in which X and Z predict Y.  The emoticon graph shows an indirect effect, and the 123 graph might represent a correlation matrix.

A key idea of a graphical model is that of <span class="emph">conditional independence</span>, something one should keep in mind when constructing their models.  The concept can be demonstrated with the following graph.

```{r conditionalIndependence, echo=FALSE, eval=T}
tags$div(style="width:500px; margin:0 auto; font-family:Roboto; font-size:50%", 
DiagrammeR::DiagrammeR("scripts/condindie.gv", type='grViz', width=500, height=250))
# <img src="img/conditionalIndependence.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; width:25%">
```

<br>
In this graph, X is *conditionally independent* of Z given Y- there is no correlation between X and Z once Y is accounted for[^condind].  We will revisit this concept when discussing path analysis and latent variable models.  Graphs can be *directed*, *undirected*, or *mixed*. Directed graphs have arrows, sometimes implying a causal flow (a difficult endeavor to demonstrate explicitly) or noting a time component. Undirected graphs merely denote relations among the nodes, while mixed graphs might contain both directional and symmetric relationships.  Most of the models discussed in this document will be directed or mixed.


## Directed Graphs

As noted previously, we can represent standard models as graphical models.  In most of these cases we'd be dealing with directed or mixed graphs.  Almost always we are specifically dealing with directed *acyclic* graphs, where there are no feedback loops.


### Standard linear model

Let's start with the standard linear model (SLiM), i.e. a basic regression we might estimate via ordinary least squares (but not necessarily). In this setting, we want to examine the effect of each potential predictor (x* in the graph) on the target variable (y).  The following shows what the graphical model might look like.


```{r SLiMasGraph, echo=FALSE, fig.width=2, fig.height=3, fig.align='center', cache=FALSE, eval=F}
# library(lavaan)
# X = cbind(1, matrix(rnorm(150), 50))
# y = X %*% c(2,.2,-.2,0) + rnorm(50)
# d = data.frame(X1 = X[,2], X2=X[,3], X3=X[,4], y)
# model = "
# y ~ X1 + X2 + X3
# "
# out = sem(model, data=d)
# psych::lavaan.diagram(out, regression=TRUE)
# 
# # X7 <- matrix(c("a","b","c","d","e","f"),nrow=6)
# # structure.diagram(X7,regression=TRUE)
# 
# 
# d = matrix(c('', '',''), nrow=3)
# psych::structure.diagram(d,regression=TRUE, labels=c('X1', 'X2', 'X3','Y'))
# 
# 
# library(DiagrammeR)
DiagrammeR::grViz("scripts/SLiM.gv")
```

<img src="img/regasgraph.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; width:50%">

While we start simpler, we can use much of the same sort of thinking with more complex models later.  In what follows, we'll show that whether we use a standard R modeling approach (via the <span class="func">lm</span> function), or an SEM approach (via the <span class="func">sem</span> function in <span class="pack">lavaan</span>), the results are identical (aside from the fact that sem is using maximum likelihood, so the variances will be slightly different).  First, we'll with the standard <span class="func">lm</span> approach.

```{r lmvslavaan1, cache=TRUE}
mcclelland = haven::read_dta('data/path_analysis_data.dta')
lmModel = lm(math21 ~ male + math7 + read7 + momed, data=mcclelland)
```

Now we can do the same model using the lavaan package, and while the input form will change a bit, and the output will be presented in a manner consistent with SEM, the estimated parameters are identical. Note that the square of the residual standard error in the <span class="func">lm</span> output is compared to the variance estimate in the lavaan output.

```{r lmvslavaan2, cache=TRUE}
library(lavaan)
model = "
  math21 ~ male + math7 + read7 + momed 
"
semModel = sem(model, data=mcclelland, meanstructure = TRUE)

summary(lmModel)
summary(semModel, rsq=T)
```

As we will see in more detail later, SEM incorporates more complicated regression models, but at this point it has the exact same interpretation as our standard regression because there is no difference between the two models. As we go along, we can see the structural equation models as generalizations of those we are already well acquainted with, and so one can use that prior knowledge as a basis for understanding the newer ones.

### Path Analysis

<span class='emph'>Path Analysis</span>, and thus SEM, while new to some, is in fact a very, very old technique, statistically speaking[^pathOld].  It can be seen as a generalization of the SLiM approach that can allow for indirect effects and multiple target variables.  Path analysis also has a long history in the econometrics literature though under different names (e.g. instrumental variable regression, 2-stage least squares etc.), and through the computer science realm through the use of graphical models more generally.  As such, there are many tools at your disposal for examining such models, and I'll iterate that much of the SEM perspective on modeling comes largely from specific disciplines (especially psychology and education), while other approaches that are very common in other disciplines may be better for your situation.


#### Types of relationships

The types of potential relationships examined by path analysis can be seen below.

Most models deal only with <span class="emph">direct effects</span>.  In this case there are no intervening variables we wish to consider.  If such variables do exist, we are then dealing with what is often called a mediation model, and must interpret both <span class="emph">indirect</span> and (potentially) direct effects.  When dealing with multiple outcomes, some may have predictors in common, such that the outcomes' correlation can be explained by those <span class="emph">common causes</span> (this will come up in factor analysis later).  Often there are <span class="emph">unanalyzed correlations</span>. As an example, every time you run a regression, the correlations among predictor variables are left 'unanalyzed'. 


#### Multiple Targets

While relatively seldom used, multivariate linear regression[^mvreg] is actually very straightforward in some programming environments such as R, and conducting models with multivariate outcomes does not require anything specific to SEM, but that is the realm we'll stick with.  Using the [McClelland data][McClelland], let's try it for ourselves. First, let's look at the data to get a sense of things.

```{r mcclellandCors, cache=FALSE, echo=F, fig.align='center'}
psych::describe(mcclelland)
numericdat = select(mcclelland, -college, -college_missing, -male, -adopted)
tags$div(style="width:250px; margin:0 auto;",
         corrheat(cor(numericdat, use='pair'), width=350, height=350)) 
```
<br>
While these are only weakly correlated variables to begin with, one plausible model might try to predict math and reading at age 21 with measures taken at prior years. 

```{r paMultipleTargets, cache=TRUE}
model = "
  read21 ~ attention4 + vocab4 + read7
  math21 ~ attention4 + math7
  read21 ~~ 0*math21
"
mvregModel  = sem(model, data=mcclelland, missing='listwise', meanstructure = T)
coef(mvregModel)
```

The last line of the model code clarifies that we are treating **math21** and **read21** as independent, and as such we are simply running two separate regressions simultaneously.  Note also that the coefficients in the output with `~1` are the intercepts.  We can compare this to standard R regression.  A first step is taken to make the data equal to what was used in <span class="pack">lavaan</span>. For that we can use the <span class="pack">dplyr</span> package to select the necessary variables for the model, and then omit rows that have any missing.

```{r regvspath1, cache=TRUE}
mcclellandComplete = select(mcclelland, read21, math21, attention4, vocab4, read7, math7) %>% 
  na.omit
lm(read21 ~ attention4 + vocab4 + read7, data=mcclellandComplete)
lm(math21 ~ attention4 + math7, data=mcclellandComplete)
```

Note that had the models for both outcomes been identical, we could have run both outcomes simultaneously using <span class="func">cbind</span> on the DVs[^notmvreg]. However, we can and probably should estimate the covariance of math and reading skill at age 21.  Let's rerun the path analysis removing that <span class="emph">constraint</span>.

```{r paMultipleTargets2, cache=TRUE}
model = "
  read21 ~ attention4 + vocab4 + read7
  math21 ~ attention4 + math7
"
mvregModel  = sem(model, data=mcclelland, missing='listwise', meanstructure = T)
coef(mvregModel)
```

We can see that the coefficients are now slightly different from the SLiM approach. The `read21~~math21` value represents the residual covariance between math and reading at age 21, i.e. after accounting for the other covariate relationships modeled, it tells us how correlated those skills are. Using <span class='func'>summary</span> will show it to be statistically significant.  I additionally ask for standardized output to see the correlation along with the covariance.  It actually is not very strong even if it is statistically significant.

```{r summaryPaMultipleTargets2, eval=T, cache=TRUE}
summary(mvregModel, standardized=T)
```

Whether or not to take a multivariate/path-analytic approach vs. separate regressions is left to the researcher. It's perhaps easier to explain univariate models in some circumstances.  But as the above shows, it doesn't take much to take into account correlated target variables.


#### Indirect Effects

So path analysis allows for multiple target variables, with the same or a mix of covariates for each target.  What about <span class='emph'>indirect effects</span>? Standard regression models examine direct effects only, and the regression coefficients reflect that direct effect.  However, perhaps we think a particular covariate causes some change in another, which then causes some change in the target variable.  This is especially true when some measures are collected at different time points.  Note that in SEM, any variable in which an arrow is pointing to it in the graphical depiction is often called an <span class="emph">endogenous</span> variable, while those that only have arrows going out from them are <span class="emph">exogenous</span>.  Exogenous variables may still have (unanalyzed) correlations among them.  As we will see later, both observed and latent variables may be endogenous or exogenous.

Consider the following model.


```{r mediationDiag, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
tags$div(style="width:500px; margin:0 auto; font-family:Roboto; font-size:50%",
         DiagrammeR::grViz('scripts/mediation.gv', width=500, height=250))

# DiagrammeR::grViz('scripts/mediation.gv')

```


Here we posit attention span and vocabulary at age 4 as indicative of what to expect for reading skill at age 7, and that is ultimately seen as a precursor to adult reading ability. In this model, attention span and vocabulary at 4 only have an indirect effect on adult reading ability through earlier reading skill.  At least temporally it makes sense, so let's code this up.

```{r mediationModel, cache=TRUE}
model = "
  read21 ~ read7
  read7 ~ attention4 + vocab4
"

mediationModel  = sem(model, data=mcclelland)
summary(mediationModel, rsquare=TRUE)
```

What does this tell us? As before, we interpret the results as we would any other regression model, though conceptually there are two sets of models to consider (though they are estimated simultaneously[^oldMediation]), one for reading at age 7 and one for reading at age 21. And indeed, one can think of path analysis as a series of linked regression models[^linkedreg]. Here we have positive relationships between both attention and vocabulary at age 4 and reading at age 7, and a positive effect of reading at age 7 on reading at age 21.  Statistically speaking, our model appears to be viable, as there appear to be statistically significant estimates for each path. 

However, look at the R^2^ value for reading at age 7.  We now see that there is little to no *practical* effect of the age 4 variables at all, as all we are accounting for is < 4% of the variance, and all that we have really discovered is that prior reading ability affects later reading ability.  

We can test the indirect effect itself by labeling the paths in the model code.  In the following code, I label them based on the first letter of the variables involved (e.g. `vr` refers to the vocab to reading path), but note that these are arbitrary names.  I also add the direct effects of the early age variable. While the indirect effect for vocab is statistically significant, as we already know there is not a strong correlation between these two variables, it's is largely driven by the strong relationship between reading at age 7 and reading at age 21, which is probably not all that interesting.  A comparison of AIC values, something we'll talk more about later, would favor a model with only direct effects[^medvsdirectModcomp].

```{r mediationModelTestIndir, cache=TRUE}
model = "
  read21 ~ rr*read7 + attention4 + vocab4
  read7 ~ ar*attention4 + vr*vocab4
  
  # Indirect effects
  att4_read21 := ar*rr
  vocab4_read21 := vr*rr
"

mediationModel  = sem(model, data=mcclelland)
summary(mediationModel, rsquare=TRUE, fit=T, std=T)
```


In the original article, I did not find their description or diagrams of the models detailed enough to know precisely what the model was in the actual study[^mccnodescript], but here is at least one interpretation if you'd like to examine it further.

```{r mcclellandStudy, eval=FALSE, cache=TRUE}
modReading = "
  read21 ~ read7 + attention4 + vocab4 + male + adopted + momed
  read7 ~ attention4 + vocab4
"
reading  = sem(modReading, data=mcclelland, missing='fiml', mimic = 'Mplus', std.ov=TRUE)
summary(reading, rsquare=TRUE)
```



#### More mediation

Here I would like to demonstrate a powerful approach to mediation models using Imai's <span class="pack">mediation</span> package. It is based on a theoretical framework that allows for notably complex models for mediator, outcome or both, including different types of variables for the mediator and outcome.  While it is simple to conduct, the results suggest there are more things to think about when it comes to mediation.  

To begin, we will run two separate models, one for the mediator and one for the outcome, using the mediate function to use them to estimate the mediation effect. In this case we'll focus on the indirect effect of attention.


```{r imai0, cache=F, echo=F, eval=FALSE}
# due to time and mediation loading everything under the sun, just run this and
# save out as RData; show the next one so you don't have comment signs
library(mediation)
mediator_model = lm(read7 ~ attention4 + vocab4, data=mcclellandComplete)
outcome_model = lm(read21 ~ read7 + attention4 + vocab4, data=mcclellandComplete)
results = mediate(mediator_model, outcome_model, treat="attention4", mediator = 'read7')
save(results, file='data/imai_results.RData')
```


```{r imai, cache=F, eval=FALSE}
library(mediation)
mediator_model = lm(read7 ~ attention4 + vocab4, data=mcclellandComplete)
outcome_model = lm(read21 ~ read7 + attention4 + vocab4, data=mcclellandComplete)
results = mediate(mediator_model, outcome_model, treat="attention4", mediator = 'read7')
summary(results)
```
```{r printImai, echo=FALSE}
load('data/imai_results.RData')
mediation::summary.mediate(results)
```



```{r removeMASS, include=FALSE, eval=F}
# sigh; if you do run the previous chunk
detach(package:mediation); detach(package:MASS)
```


The first thing to note is that there are multiple results to consider, we have the average causal mediated effect, the average direct effect, the total effect and the proportion mediated. What is an <span class="emph">average causal mediated effect</span>?  First, think about a standard experimental design in which participants are assigned to control and treatment groups.  Ideally, if we really wanted to know about true effects, we'd see the outcome when an individual was a control and when they were were in the treatment. The true *causal* effect for an individual would be the difference between their scores when in the control and when in the treatment. Thus there are two hypothetical situations of different conditions, or <span class="emph">counterfactuals</span>, of interest- what would be the *potential* outcome of a control case if they treated, and vice versa for those in the treated group[^potout_vs_counterfact].

This <span class="emph">potential outcomes framework</span> is the essence of the <span class="func">mediate</span> function. In the presence of a mediator variable, we can start by defining the <span class="emph">average direct effect</span> (ζ) as follows, where $Y_i$ is the potential outcome for unit $i$ (e.g. a person), $M_i$ the potential outcome of the mediator, and $T_i$ the treatment status. From the mediate function help file[^imai_links]:

> The expected difference in the potential outcome when the treatment is changed but the mediator is held constant at the value that would realize if the treatment equals $t$

$$ζ(t) = E[Y(t_1, M(t)) - Y(t_0, M(t))]$$

The **ACME** meanwhile is:

> The expected difference (δ) in the *potential outcome* when the mediator took the value that would realize under the treatment condition as opposed to the control condition, while the treatment status itself is held constant.

$$δ(t) = E[Y(t, M(t_1)) - Y(t, M(t_0))]$$


> where $t$, $t_1$, $t_0$ are particular values of the treatment T such that $t_1 \neq t_0$, M(t) is the potential mediator, and Y(t,m) is the potential outcome variable.

Adding these two gives us the <span class="emph">total effect</span>.  In the case of continuous variables, the values for 'control' and 'treatment' are fixed to specific values of interest, but by default represent a unit difference in the values of the variable. The results of the <span class="func">mediate</span> function are based on a simulation approach, and averaged over those simulations.  You'll note there is also a 'proportion of effect mediated'. This is the size of the ACME to the the total effect.  It too is averaged over the simulations (and thus is not simply the ACME/Total Effect reported values).  It's not clear to me how useful of a notion this is, and as noted by the boundaries, it's actually a ratio as opposed to a true proportion (as calculated), such that under some simulations the value can be negative or greater than 1.


You may compare the result with the previous <span class="pack">lavaan</span> results.  I've rerun it with bootstrap estimates (set `se='boot'`) to be more in keeping with the simulation approach of Imai[^bootmed].   You could also use the <span class="pack">blavaan</span> package to get true Bayesian estimates.

```{r imai_vs_lavaan, echo=F, cache=T}
mediationModel  = sem(model, data=mcclelland, se='boot')
# lavaan estimate
parameterestimates(mediationModel) %>% 
  filter(label=='att4_read21' | (lhs =='read21' & rhs=='attention4')) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.numeric, round, digits=3) %>% 
  arrange(lhs)

# comparison sims
# coefs = mvrnorm(1000, mu=coef(outcome_model), Sigma=vcov(outcome_model))
# de = matrix(c(1,0,0,0,1,0,1,0), ncol=4, byrow=T) %*% t(coefs)
# mean(apply(de, 2, diff))
```

As expected, the results of <span class="pack">lavaan</span> and <span class="pack">mediation</span> packages largely agree with one another.  However, the potential outcomes framework has the *product-of-paths* approach as a special case, and thus generalizes to different models and types of variables for the mediator and outcome.


##### Explicit Example

While we have shown how to use the tool and compared the outputs, let's make things more simple and explicit to be sure that we understand what's going on. Consider the following three variable setup with estimated parameters.  We have a treatment variable that is dummy coded with 0 = 'Control group' and 1 = 'Treatment group', a continuous Mediator and Target variable.

```{r cfgraph, echo=FALSE}
tags$div(style="width:500px; margin:0 auto; font-family:Roboto; font-size:50%", 
DiagrammeR::DiagrammeR("scripts/counterfact.gv", type='grViz', width=500, height=250))
```

In addition, we'll consider just a single individual, whose observed values are 'control', i.e. 0, 3 for the mediator, and 2 for the target.  The unique values that represent invariant characteristics regardless of changes to interventions or counterfactual hypotheses are.

$\epsilon_1 = 0$

$\epsilon_2 = 3 - 0*.3 = 3$

$\epsilon_3 = 2 - 0*.5 - 3*.2 = 1.4$


If a person is in the control group, this setup suggests the predicted value for the Target would be 3\*.2 + 1.4 = 2.  Let's now figure out what the value would be if this person was in the treatment.  The Mediator value would  now be 3 + 1\*.3 = 3.3.  This would in turn result in a predicted Target value as follows: 1.4 + 3.3\*.2 + 1\*.5 = 2.56. And we could take this approach for other situations.  We could, for example, ask what the expected value be if the Treatment level is 0, but the Mediator was at whatever value it would have been, had the person received the treatment?  The value is 3.3\*.2 + 1.4 = 2.06, which if we subtract from when they are are fully in the control group gives us the mediated effect 2.06 - 2 = .06.  In this linear model it is equivalent to the product-of-paths approach, .3\*.2.  But now we don't have to be restricted to linear models.

```{r echo=F, eval=F}
set.seed(123)
N = 10000
Treatment = rbinom(N, size=1, p=.5)
Mediator = 3 + .3*Treatment + rnorm(N, sd=.1)
Target = 0 + .5*Treatment + .2*Mediator + rnorm(N, sd=.1)
d = data_frame(Treatment, Mediator, Target)

cf = '
Mediator ~ Treatment
Target ~ Mediator + Treatment
'


cfmod = sem(cf, data=d)
# summary(cfmod)
# semPlot::semPaths(cfmod, what = 'est', style = 'lisrel', nDigits = 1, layout = 'tree2', rotation = 2)

library(mediation)
mediator_model = lm(Mediator ~ Treatment, data=d)
outcome_model = lm(Target ~ Treatment  + Mediator, data=d)
med_result = mediate(model.m = mediator_model, model.y = outcome_model, treat = 'Treatment', mediator = 'Mediator')
summary(med_result)
```




#### Cavets about indirect effects

One should think very hard about positing an indirect effect, especially if there is no time component or obvious pseudo-causal path.  If the effect isn't immediately obvious, or you are dealing with cross-sectional data, then you should probably just examine the direct effects.  Unlike other standard explorations one might do with models (e.g. look for nonlinear relationships), the underlying causal connection and associated assumptions are more explicit in this context.  Many models I've seen in consulting struck me as arbitrary as far as which covariate served as the mediator, required a fairly convoluted explanation for its justification, or ignored other relevant variables because the reasoning would have to include a plethora of indirect effects if it were to be logically consistent.  Furthermore, I can often ask one or two questions and will discover that researchers are actually interested in interactions (i.e. moderation), rather than indirect effects.

This document will not get into models that have *moderated mediation* and *mediated moderation*. In my experience these are often  associated with models that are difficult to interpret at best, or are otherwise not grounded very strongly in substantive concerns[^modmed].  However, there are times, e.g. in experimental settings, which surprisingly few SEM are applied to for reasons unknown, where perhaps it would be very much appropriate. It is left to the reader to investigate those particular complexities when the time comes.

Too often investigators will merely throw in these indirect effects and simply report whether the effect is significant or not. If you hide their results and ask if the indirect effect is positive or negative, I suspect they might not even know.  Even if not used, I think the perspective of the potential outcomes framework can help one think appropriately about the situation, and avoid unnecessary complications. If one wants to *explore* possible indirect paths, there are better [approaches][Bayesian Networks] which are still rooted within the structural causal model framework, which we'll see shortly.  In addition, a mediation model should always be compared to a simpler model with no mediation (e.g. via AIC).



#### Terminology issues

Some refer to models with indirect effects as <span class="emph">mediation</span> models[^kline_indvmed], and that terminology appears commonly in the SEM (and esp. psychology) literature[^buffer].  Many applied researchers just starting out with SEM often confuse the term with <span class="emph">moderation</span>, which is called an <span class="emph">interaction</span> in every other statistical modeling context. As you begin your SEM journey, referring to <span class="emph">indirect effects</span> and <span class="emph">interactions</span> will likely keep you clear on what you're modeling, and perhaps be clearer to those who may not be as familiar with SEM when you present your work.

In models with moderation, one will often see a specific variable denoted as the *moderator*. However, this is completely arbitrary in the vast majority of situations in which it is used. In a typical model that includes an interaction, it makes just as much sense to say that the $\mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ relationship varies as a function of $\mathcal{B}$ as it does the $\mathcal{B} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ relationship varies as a function of $\mathcal{A}$.  Some suggest using the term *moderation* when only when there is a potential causal relation, almost always temporal in nature, such that the moderator variable precedes the variable in question. In addition, the moderator and the variable moderated must be *uncorrelated*[^wuzumbo].  While such restrictions would render almost every model I've ever seen that uses the term moderation as an ordinary interaction instead, the idea is that the moderator has a causal effect on the path between the variable in question and its target.  This is why you see silly graphs like the one to the left below, which has no tie to any statistical model and generally confuses people more often than it illuminates (the *correct* graph is to the right).  Again though, the actual model is statistically indistinguishable from a standard model including an interaction, so if you want to understand moderation, you simply need to understand what an interaction is.

<div class='col2'><img src="img/moderation.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; width:75%">

```{r modpic, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE, fig.align='right'}
tags$div(style="width:500px; margin:0 auto; font-family:Roboto; font-size:50%", 
DiagrammeR::DiagrammeR("scripts/moderation.gv", type='grViz', width=400, height=200))
```
</div>
<br>
Recently I have also heard the phrase 'spotlight analysis' to refer to a categorical by continuous variable interaction. Please don't apply new terms to very old techniques in an attempt to make a model sound more interesting[^psychlit]. The work should speak for itself and be as clearly expressed as possible.

The gist is that if you want to talk about your relations using the terms 'mediation' and 'moderation' you'll want to have specific and explicit causal relations among the variables.  If you are unsure, then the answer is clearly that you don't have that situation.  However, you can still incorporate interactions as usual, and explore potential indirect effects by modeling the correlations, e.g. leaving the indirect path undirected.


#### Aside: Instrumental variables

Path analysis of a different sort has a long history in econometrics.  A very common approach one may see utilized is <span class="emph">instrumental variable</span> analysis. The model can be depicted graphically as follows:

```{r ivmodel, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
tags$div(style="width:500px; margin:0 auto; font-family:Roboto; font-size:50%",
         DiagrammeR::grViz('scripts/iv.gv', width=500, height=250))
```

In the graph, $\mathcal{Y}$ is our target variable, $\mathcal{X}$ is the causal variable of interest, and $\mathcal{Z}$ the instrument. The instrumental variable must not be correlated with disturbance of the target variable (later depicted as $\mathcal{U}$), and only has an indirect relation to $\mathcal{Y}$ through $\mathcal{X}$.  Neither target nor causal variable are allowed to effect the instrument directly or indirectly.  In graph theory, this involves the notion of conditional independence we've mentioned before, where $\mathcal{Z}$ is conditionally independent of Y given X, or in other words, if we remove the $\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ path, $\mathcal{Z}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$ are independent.  Furthermore, $\mathcal{Z}$ is *not* conditionally independent of $\mathcal{X}$ with the removal of that path[^direct].

The motivating factor for such a model is that the simple $\mathcal{X} \rightarrow \mathcal{Y}$ path may not provide a means for determining a causal relationship, particularly if $\mathcal{X}$ is correlated with the error. As an example[^CamTriv], if we look at the relationship of earnings with education, the unspecified causes of earnings might include things, e.g. some general 'ability', that would be correlated with the potential causal variable of education attained. With error $\mathcal{U}$ we can show the following diagram that depicts the problem.

```{r ivxyu, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
tags$div(style="width:500px; margin:0 auto; font-family:Roboto; font-size:50%",
         DiagrammeR::grViz('scripts/ivxyu.gv', width=500, height=250))
```

When $\mathcal{X}$ is endogenous, that is not the case. Changes in $\mathcal{X}$ are associated with $\mathcal{Y}$, but also $\mathcal{U}$.

```{r ivxyu2, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
tags$div(style="width:500px; margin:0 auto; font-family:Roboto; font-size:50%",
         DiagrammeR::grViz('scripts/ivxyu2.gv', width=500, height=250))
```


There are now multiple effects of $\mathcal{X}$ on $\mathcal{Y}$, both directly from $\mathcal{X}$ and indirectly from $\mathcal{U}$.  We can measure the association between $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Y}$, but not the causal relationship.

An attempt can be made to remedy the problem by using an instrument, leading the following graph.

```{r ivxyzu, echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE, cache=FALSE, fig.align='center'}
tags$div(style="width:500px; margin:0 auto; font-family:Roboto; font-size:50%",
         DiagrammeR::grViz('scripts/ivxyzu.gv', width=500, height=250))
```

The instrument $\mathcal{Z}$ affects $\mathcal{X}$ and thus is correlated with $\mathcal{Y}$ indirectly.  However, unlike $\mathcal{X}$, it is uncorrelated with $\mathcal{U}$.  This assumption excludes $\mathcal{Z}$ from having a direct effect in the
model for $\mathcal{Y}$. If instead $\mathcal{Y}$ depended on both $\mathcal{X}$ and $\mathcal{Z}$ but only $\mathcal{X}$ has a direct path to $\mathcal{Y}$, then $\mathcal{Z}$ is basically absorbed into the error so would be correlated with it. With the direct path from $\mathcal{Z}$ to $\mathcal{Y}$ not allowed, we are left with only its influence on $\mathcal{X}$ .


Such models were commonly fit with a technique known two-stage least squares, which is demonstrated here.  I use a subset of the <span class="objclass">CigarettesSW</span> data set and <span class="func">ivreg</span> function from the <span class="pack">AER</span> package for comparison.  The data concerns cigarette consumption for the 48 continental US States from 1985–1995, though only the last year is used for our purposes.  Here we examine the effect on packs per capita (packs) of price (rprice), using state level income (rincome) as the instrumental variable. See the help file for the <span class="objclass">CigarettesSW</span> for more on this data.

```{r ivreg, echo=-c(1:7, 10:11, 22), cache=TRUE}
# library(AER) # don't use AER directly since AER loads several plus their deps including MASS
data("CigarettesSW", package = "AER")
CigarettesSW$rprice = with(CigarettesSW, price/cpi)
CigarettesSW$rincome = with(CigarettesSW, income/population/cpi)
CigarettesSW$tdiff = with(CigarettesSW, (taxs - tax)/cpi)
Cigarettes = select(CigarettesSW, state, rprice, rincome, tdiff, tax, cpi, packs, year) %>% 
  filter(year=='1995')

head(Cigarettes)  # raw, logged values actually used in models

Ciglog  = select(Cigarettes, packs, rprice, rincome) %>% 
  mutate_all(log)
Cigarettes = Ciglog

# explicit 2sls
mod0 = lm(rprice ~  rincome , data = Cigarettes)
lm(packs ~ fitted(mod0), data = Cigarettes) 

## using AER package
ivmod = AER::ivreg(packs ~ rprice | rincome,  data = Cigarettes)
summary(ivmod)

ymod = lm(packs ~ rincome, data = Cigarettes)
```

We can see that these both produce the same results, though actually doing the piecemeal regression would lead to problematic standard errors.  However, by using the fitted values from the regression of $\mathcal{X}$ on $\mathcal{Z}$, we are now able to essentially get the effect of $\mathcal{X}$ untainted by $\mathcal{U}$.  To see more clearly where the effect comes from, the coefficient of regressing `packs` on `income` is `r  round(coef(ymod)[2], 3)`, and dividing that by the coefficient of `price` on `income`, `r round(coef(mod0)[2], 3)`, will provide the ultimate effect of price on the pack of cigarettes that we see above.

We can run the path model in <span class="pack">lavaan</span> as well. Note the slight difference between what we'd normally code up for a path model. In order to get the same results as instrumental variable regression, we have to explicitly add an estimate of the packs disturbance with price.

```{r lavaan_ivreg, cache=TRUE}
mod = '
  packs ~ rprice
  rprice ~ rincome
  packs ~~ rprice
'

modiv = sem(mod, data=Ciglog, meanstructure = T, se = 'robust')
summary(modiv)
```

While instrumental variable regression is common, this is perhaps not a typical path model seen in SEM. With SEM, a model comparison approach might be taken to compare models of competing complexity.  One issue not discussed is where instruments come from.  Generally data is not collected with acquiring them in mind, so it might be very difficult to use such an analysis.  Furthermore, the structured causal framework that includes SEM would generally be a more flexible approach.



#### Aside: Nonrecursive Models

Recursive models have all unidirectional causal effects and disturbances are not correlated. A model is considered nonrecursive if there is a reciprocal relationship, feedback loop, or correlated disturbance in the model[^nonrecursiveName]. Nonrecursive models are potentially problematic when there is not enough information to estimate the model (unidentified model), which is a common concern with them.

A classic example of a nonrecursive relationship is marital satisfaction: the more satisfied one partner is, the more satisfied the other, and vice versa (at least that's the theory). This can be represented by a simple model (below).


```{r nonRecursive, echo=F, fig.align='center', fig.height=2, dev='svg'}
WifeSatisfaction = rnorm(100)
HusbandSatisfaction = rnorm(100)
WifeEdu = rnorm(100)
HusbandEdu = rnorm(100)
FamIncome = rnorm(100)

model1 = '
WifeSatisfaction ~ .25*HusbandSatisfaction
HusbandSatisfaction ~ .5*WifeSatisfaction

WifeSatisfaction ~~ HusbandSatisfaction
HusbandSatisfaction ~~ 1*HusbandSatisfaction
WifeSatisfaction ~~ 1*WifeSatisfaction
'

m1 = sem(model1, data=data.frame(WifeSatisfaction, HusbandSatisfaction))
semPlot::semPaths(m1, layout='tree2', style='lisrel',rotation=2, covAtResiduals=F, 
                  # whatLabels = 'par', 
                  sizeMan=10, edge.label.cex=1.5, color='#ff5503', borders=F, 
                  label.color='#ffffff') # simply doesn't plot nonrecursive models correctly
```

Such models are notoriously difficult to specify in terms of *identification*, which we will talk more about later.  For now, we can simply say the above model would not even be estimated as there are more parameters to estimate (two paths, two variances) than there is information in the data (two variances and one covariance).

To make this model identified, we use <span class="emph">instrumental variables</span> as we did before. In this scenario, instrumental variables directly influence one of the variables in a recursive relationship, but not the other. For example, a wife’s education can influence her satisfaction directly and a husband’s education can influence his satisfaction directly, but a husband’s education cannot directly impact a wife’s satisfaction and vice versa (at least for this demonstration). These instrumental variables can indirectly impact a spouses’ satisfaction.  In the following model family income is also included.  The dashed line represents an unanalyzed correlation.

```{r nonRecursive2, echo=F, fig.align='center', dev='svg'}
model2 = '
WifeSatisfaction + HusbandSatisfaction ~ FamIncome
FamIncome ~ WifeEdu + HusbandEdu
WifeSatisfaction ~ HusbandSatisfaction + WifeEdu
HusbandSatisfaction ~ WifeSatisfaction + HusbandEdu
'

m2 = sem(model2, data=data.frame(WifeSatisfaction, HusbandSatisfaction, WifeEdu, HusbandEdu, FamIncome))
semPlot::semPaths(m2, layout='tree2', rotation=2, style='lisrel', curvePivot=T, nCharNodes=3,
                  sizeMan=10, edge.label.cex=1.5, color='#ff5503', borders=F, 
                  label.color='#ffffff') # simply doesn't plot res cov
```


Many instances of nonrecursive models might better be represented by a correlation.  One must have a very strong theoretical motivation for such models, which is probably why they aren't seen as often in the SEM literature, though they are actually quite common in some areas such as economics, where theory is assumed to be stronger (by economists).


#### Aside: Tracing rule

In a recursive model, <span class="emph">implied correlations</span> between two variables, X1 and X2, can be found using <span class="emph">tracing rules</span>. Implied correlations between variables in a model are equal to the sum of the product of all standardized coefficients for the paths between them. Valid tracings are all routes between X1 and X2 that a) do not enter the same variable twice, and b) do not enter a variable through an arrowhead and leave through an arrowhead. The following examples assume the variables have been standardized (variance values equal to 1), if standardization has not occurred the variance of variables passed through should be included in the product of tracings.

Consider the following variables, A, B, and C (in a data frame called <span class="objclass">abc</span>) with a model seen in the below diagram. We are interested in identifying the implied correlation between x and z by decomposing the relationship into its different components and using tracing rules.

```{r traceCoefsInit, echo=F}
# because of MASS screwing up other packages; 
cormat = lazerhawk::createCorr(c(.2,.3,.7))
abc = MASS::mvrnorm(100, mu=rep(0,3), Sigma=cormat, empirical=TRUE)
colnames(abc) = LETTERS[1:3]
# psych::describe(abc)
```
<!-- something about semplot is screwy too, so don't cache it either -->

```{r traceCoefs, echo=-7, cache=F}
cor(abc)

model = "
  C ~ B + A
  B ~ A
"

pathMod = sem(model, data=abc)
coef(pathMod)
semPlot::semPaths(pathMod, whatLabels = 'par', style = 'lisrel',  
                  sizeMan=10, edge.label.cex=1.5, color='#ff5503', borders=F, 
                  label.color='#ffffff')
```

To reproduce the correlation between A and C (sometimes referred to as a 'total effect'):

- Corr = ac + ab * ac
- Corr = `r paste(round(coef(pathMod)[1],3), '+', round(prod(coef(pathMod)[2:3]),3))`
- Corr = `r coef(pathMod)[1] + prod(coef(pathMod)[2:3])`


In SEM models, it's important to consider how well our model-implied correlations correspond to the actual observed correlations. For *over-identified* models, the correlations will not be reproduced exactly, and thus can serve as a measure of how well our model fits the data. We'll discuss this more later.  In addition, the tracing of paths is important in understanding the <span class="emph">structural causal models</span> approach of Judea Pearl, of which SEM and the potential outcomes framework are part of.



## Bayesian Networks

In many cases of path analysis, the path model is not strongly supported by prior research or intuition, and in other cases, people are willing to use <span class='emph'>modification indices</span> after the fact to change the paths in their model. This is unfortunate, as their model is generally *overfit* to begin with, and more so if altered in such an ad hoc fashion.

A more exploratory approach to graphical models is available however.  <span class="emph">Bayesian Networks</span>, an approach within Pearl's structural causal model framework and which led to its development, are an alternative to graphical modeling of the sort we've been doing. Though they can be used to produce exactly the same results that we obtain with path analysis via maximum likelihood estimation, they can also be used for constrained or wholly exploratory endeavors as well, potentially with regularization in place to help reduce overfitting.

As an example, I use the McClelland data to explore potential paths via the <span class='pack'>bnlearn</span> package.  I make the constraints that variables later in time do not effect variables earlier in time[^time_cause], no variables are directed toward background characteristics like sex, and at least for these purposes I keep math and reading at a particular time from having paths to each other.  I show some of the so-called *blacklist* of constraints here.  Note that we can also require certain paths be in the model via a *whitelist*.

```{r blacklist, echo=F, eval=-c(3:10), cache=T}
mcclellandNoCollege = select(mcclelland, -college, -college_missing) %>% 
  na.omit %>% 
  sapply(as.numeric) %>% 
  data.frame
blacklist = data.frame(from = c(rep(c('read21', 'math21'), each=7), rep(c('read7','math7'), each=5),
                                rep(c('vocab4', 'attention4'), each=3),
                                rep(c('adopted',  'male', 'momed'), times=2),
                                'math21','read21', 'math7','read7'),
                       to = c(rep(c('read7', 'math7', 'attention4', 'vocab4', 'adopted',  'male', 'momed'), times=2),
                              rep(c('attention4', 'vocab4', 'adopted',  'male', 'momed'), times=2),
                              rep(c('adopted',  'male', 'momed'), times=2),
                              c('male',  'momed', 'adopted'), c('momed',  'adopted', 'male'),
                              'read21', 'math21','read7','math7'))
blacklist2 = data.frame(from = c(rep(c('read21', 'math21'), each=7), rep(c('read7','math7'), each=5),
                               rep(c('vocab4', 'attention4'), each=3),
                               rep(c('adopted',  'male', 'momed'), times=2)),
                      to = c(rep(c('read7', 'math7', 'attention4', 'vocab4', 'adopted',  'male', 'momed'), times=2),
                             rep(c('attention4', 'vocab4', 'adopted',  'male', 'momed'), times=2),
                             rep(c('adopted',  'male', 'momed'), times=2),
                             c('male',  'momed', 'adopted'), c('momed',  'adopted', 'male')))

# library(bnlearn)
modelgs = bn.cv(mcclellandNoCollege, 'gs', algorithm.args = list(blacklist = blacklist, test='mi-g-sh'))
modeliamb =  bn.cv(mcclellandNoCollege, 'iamb', algorithm.args = list(blacklist = blacklist, test='mi-g-sh'))
modelinter = bn.cv(mcclellandNoCollege, 'inter.iamb', algorithm.args = list(blacklist = blacklist, test='mi-g-sh'))
plot(modelgs, modeliamb, modelinter)

head(blacklist)
```

Now we can run the model.  In this case we'll use the *Grow-Shrink* algorithm, which is one of the simpler available in the package, though others came to the same conclusion[^mcc_conclusion].

```{r bn, echo =1:2, fig.width=5, fig.height=5, fig.align='center', dev='svg', cache=F}
library(bnlearn)
model = gs(mcclellandNoCollege, blacklist = blacklist, test='mi-g-sh')  
# plot(model)
library(visNetwork); library(igraph)
g = graph_from_edgelist(model$arcs)
g = toVisNetworkData(g)
# there is no way to use circle without the label fucking the size up
visNetwork(nodes=data.frame(g$nodes, value=100), edges=g$edges, width='75%') %>% 
  visNodes(shadow=list(enabled=T, color='rgba(0,0,0,0.25)'),
           font=list(size=12, color='#fff'),
           shape='circle', 
           scaling=list(label=list(enabled=T, min=10, max=12), max=5),  
           color=list(background='#ff5503', highlight=list(background='salmon'))) %>% 
  visEdges(color='#1e90ff', arrows='to', smooth=list(enabled=T, forceDirection='horizontal')) %>% 
  visLayout(randomSeed=123)


# bn.fit(model, data=mcclellandNoCollege) # extract parameters, not shown
# model = gs(mcclellandNoCollege, blacklist = blacklist, test='mi-g-sh', undirected=TRUE)
# plot(model)
```


The plot of the model results shows that attention span at age 4 has no useful relationship to the other variables, something we'd already suspected based on previous models, and even could guess at the outset given its low correlations. As it has no connections, I've dropped it from the visualization. Furthermore, the remaining paths make conceptual sense.  The parameters, fitted values, and residuals can be extracted with the <span class='func'>bn.fit</span> function, and other diagnostic plots, cross-validation and prediction on new data are also available.

We won't get into the details of these models except to say that one should have them in their tool box. And if one really is in a more exploratory situation, they would typically come with methods far better suited for the situation than the SEM tools, none of which I come across consider predictive ability very strongly.  The discovery process with Bayesian networks can also be a lot of fun.  Even if one has strong theory, nature is always more clever than we are, and you might find something interesting.



## Undirected Graphs

So far we have been discussing directed graphs in which the implied causal flow tends toward one direction and there are no feedback loops.  However, sometimes the goal is not so much to estimate the paths as it is to find the structure.  <span class='emph'>Undirected graphs</span> simply specify the relations of nodes with edges, but without any directed arrows regarding the relationship.  Such graphs are sometimes called <span class="emph">Markov Random Fields</span>.

While we could have used the <span class="pack">bnlearn</span> package for an undirected graph by adding the argument `undirected = T`, there are a slew of techniques available for what is often called <span class='emph'>network analysis</span>.  Often the focus is on *observations*, rather than variables, and what influences whether one sees a tie/edge between nodes, with modeling techniques available for predicting ties (e.g. Exponential Random Graph models).  Often these are undirected graphs, and that is our focus here, but they do not have to be.


### Network analysis

Networks can be seen everywhere.  Personal relationships, machines and devices, various business and academic units...  we can analyze the connections among any number of things. A starting point for a very common form of network analysis is an <span class='emph'>adjacency matrix</span>, which represents connections among items we wish to analyze.  Often it contains just binary 0-1 values where 1 represents a connection between nodes. Any similarity matrix could potentially be used (e.g. a correlation matrix). Here is a simple example of an adjacency matrix:

```{r exampleAdjacency, echo=FALSE}
set.seed(1234)
adj = lazerhawk::createCorr(sample(0:1, 15, replace=TRUE, p=c(.6,.4)))
rownames(adj) = colnames(adj) = sort(c('Lagia','Nancy', 'David', "J'Sean",'Bernadette', 'Mancel'))
pander::pander(adj)
```

Visually, we can see the connections among the nodes. 

```{r exampleAdjacencyVisualized, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
# networkd3 
# library(networkD3)
# library(scales)
# 
# Links = tidyr::gather(data.frame(Source=rownames(adj), adj), key='Target', value='Value', -Source) %>%
#   mutate(Target = factor(Target, levels=levels(Source)),
#          Source = as.numeric(Source)-1,
#          Target = as.numeric(Target)-1) %>%
#   filter(Source!=Target) %>%
#   # arrange(Source) %>%
#   filter(Value==1)
# Nodes = data.frame(ID=rownames(adj), Group=1,Size=12)
# forceNetwork(Links=Links, Nodes=Nodes, Source='Source', Target='Target',
#              Value='Value', NodeID='ID', Group='Group', linkColour='#BFBFBF', colourScale='#ff5500',#alpha('gray90',1)
#              opacity=.8, fontSize=12, Nodesize='Size')
diag(adj) = 0
g = graph_from_adjacency_matrix(adj, mode='undirected')
visIgraph(g) %>% 
  visNodes(shadow=list(enabled=T, color='rgba(0,0,0,0.25)'),
           font=list(size=12, color='#FF5503'),
           shape='text', 
           scaling=list(label=list(enabled=T, min=10, max=12), max=5),  
           color=list(background='#ff5503', highlight=list(background='salmon'))) %>% 
  visEdges(color='#1e90ff', smooth=list(enabled=T, forceDirection='horizontal')) %>% 
  visLayout(randomSeed=123)

```



As an example of a network analysis, let's look at how states might be more or less similar on a few variables. We'll use the <span class='objclass'>state.x77</span> data set in base R.  It is readily available, no need for loading. To practice your R skills, use the function <span class='func'>str</span> on the state.x77 object to examine its structure, and <span class='func'>head</span> to see the first 6 rows, and `?` to find out more about it.


Here are the correlations of the variables.

```{r stateCorr, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, fig.width=4}
tags$div(style="width:350px; margin:0 auto;",
         corrheat(cor(state.x77), width=350, height=350))
```

<br>

The following depicts a graph of the states based on the variables of Life Expectancy, Median Income, High School Graduation Rate, and Illiteracy.  The colors represent the results of a community detection algorithm, and serve to show that the clustering is not merely geographical, though one cluster is clearly geographically oriented ('the South'). 


```{r stateNetwork, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE, fig.width=8}

#### Understanding Networks

Networks can be investigated in an exploratory fashion or lead to more serious modeling approaches.  The following is a brief list of common statistics or modeling techniques.

##### Centrality 

- **Degree**: how many links a node has (can also  be 'in-degree' or 'out-degree' for directed graphs)
- **Closeness**: how close a node is to other nodes
- **Betweenness**: how often a node serves as a bridge between the shortest path between two other nodes
- **PageRank**: From Google, a measure of node 'importance'
- **Hub**: a measure of the value of a node's links
- **Authority**: another measure of node importance

Characteristics of the network as a whole may also be examined, e.g. degree distribution, 'clusteriness', average path length etc.

##### Cohesion

One may wish to investigate how network members create communities and cliques. This is similar to standard cluster analysis used in other situations.  Some nodes may be isolated.


##### Modeling

- ERGM: exponential random graph models, regression modeling for network data
- Other 'link' analysis

##### Comparison

A goal might be to compare multiple networks to see if they differ in significant ways.

##### Dynamics

While many networks are 'static', many others change over time. One might be interested in this structural change by itself, or modeling something like link loss.  See the <span class="pack">ndtv</span> package for some nice visualization of such approaches.



## Summary

Graphical models are a general way to formulate and visualize statistical models. *All* statistical models can be developed within this framework.  Structured causal models provide a means to posit causal thinking with graphical models, and structural equation models may be seen as a subset of those.  Path analysis within SEM is a form of theoretically motivated graphical model involving only observed variables.  These models might include indirect effects and multiple outcomes of interest, and can be seen as an extension of more familiar regression models to such settings. However, path analysis is just one of a broad set of graphical modeling tools widely used in many disciplines, any of which might be useful for a particular data situation.


## R packages used

- <span class="pack">lavaan</span>
- <span class="pack">mediation</span>
- <span class="pack">bnlearn</span>
- <span class="pack">network</span>




[^condind]: There are other assumptions at work also, e.g. that the model is correct and there are no other confounders.

[^pathOld]: Sewall Wright first used path analysis almost 100 years ago.

[^mvreg]: I use *multivariate* here to refer to multiple dependent variables, consistent with *multivariate analysis* generally.  Some use it to mean multiple predictors, but since you're not going to see single predictor regression outside of an introductory statistical text, there is no reason to distinguish it.  Same goes for *multiple* regression.

[^notmvreg]: Note this is just a syntax shortcut to running multiple models, not an actual 'multivariate' analysis.

[^oldMediation]: In the past people would run separate OLS regressions to estimate mediation models, particularly for the most simple, three variable case. One paper that for whatever reason will not stop being cited is Baron & Kenny 1986.  *It was 1986*.  Please do not do mediation models like this.  You will always have more than three variables to consider, and always have access to R or other software that can estimate the model appropriately.  While I think it is very helpful to estimate your models in piecemeal fashion for debugging purposes and to facilitate your understanding, use appropriate tools for the model you wish to estimate.  Some packages, such as <span class='pack'>mediate</span>, may still require separate models, but there is far more going on 'under the hood' even then.  For more recent work in this area, see the efforts of [Pearl](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html) and [Imai](http://imai.princeton.edu/research/index.html) especially.

[^linkedreg]: I've seen some balk at this sort of description, but the fact remains that SEM does not have any more tie to causality than any other statistical tool, other than what applied researchers ascribe to their results.  As mentioned before, SEM does not discover causality or allow one to make causal statements simply by conducting it.  It's just a statistical model.

[^mccnodescript]: There is a statement "All results controlled for background covariates of vocabulary at age 4, gender, adoption status, and maternal education level." and a picture of only the three-variable mediation model.  If you are surprised at this lack of information, you may not be familiar with the field of psychological research.

[^psychlit]:  Unless you want to signal to people who are statistically knowledgeable that they should stop paying attention to your work. In general, it's probably best to avoid using the applied literature as a basis for how to conduct or report methods. While excellent examples may be found, many fields have typically ignored their own quantitative methodologists and statisticians for decades.  Psychology is rather notorious in this regard, while I might point to political science as a counter example, in the sense that the latter has long had one of its most popular journals a methodological one.

[^kline_indvmed]: Kline distinguishes indirect effects vs. mediation. I don't, because I don't believe SEM to have any inherently greater ability to discern causality than any other framework, and it doesn't.  I do like his suggestion that mediation be reserved for effects involving time precedence, and defaulting to 'indirect effects' should keep you out of trouble.  But even then, and as physics dictates, the arrow of time is inconsequential on a macro level. All else being equal, your model will fit as well with time 2 $\rightarrow$ time 1 as time 2 $\leftarrow$ time 1.

[^modmed]: As an example, see if you can think of a situation in which an interaction between two variables on some outcome, which technically represents a *difference* in coefficient values, would only exist indirectly. Also realize that simply positing such a situation for two variables would mean you'd have to rule out several competing models of all possible direct and indirect paths between A, B, and their product term. Just for giggles you might also consider that either A or B might have more than two categories, and so must be represented by multiple dummy coded variables and multiple interaction terms. Have fun!

[^buffer]: Along with the notion of *buffering*, which is a near useless term in my opinion.

[^wuzumbo]: See for example, Wu & Zumbo (2008) Understanding and using mediators and moderators. ([link](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-007-9143-1))

[^potout_vs_counterfact]: The historical reference for this approach is with Rubin and even earlier with Neyman.  Some may make the distinction between potential outcomes, which are *potentially* observable for everyone, and counterfactuals that are inherently unobservable.

[^imai_links]: See the package [vignette](ftp://cran.r-project.org/pub/R/web/packages/mediation/vignettes/mediation.pdf) and Imai's [papers](http://imai.princeton.edu/projects/mechanisms.html) for more detail

[^bootmed]: In general, the recommendation is to use bootstrap estimates for the indirect effect interval estimate anyway.

[^medvsdirectModcomp]: I suspect this is likely the case for the majority of modeling scenarios in social sciences that are often dealing with fairly weak effects, where the additional complexity would typically not result in better predictive value.

[^mcc_conclusion]: I have no bone to pick nor know the authors, but after seeing the models thus far, at this point I have to question the major conclusion of the McClelland et al. paper, which focuses on the effects of attention span on these outcomes, and concludes the indirect effects are notable and that there is a noteworthy direct effect on math at age 21.  To begin, the attention span variable starts with no strong linear correlation with either outcome. They admit no direct effect on reading, but then suggest there is still an indirect effect even though it is practically zero and the bulk of it clearly is the read7 $\rightarrow$ read21 path.  If demographics only predict read21 (again this isn't clear from their paper, but such a model does duplicate the few values they actually report), then the R^2^ for read7 is ~ 1.6%.  Thus I can't think of any way to conclude a direct or indirect effect of attention span at age 4 on reading at 21. The math results are only marginally better, but even there the internal fit indices are poor (e.g. rmsea etc.). Had a model comparison approach been used, AIC would not have chosen the mediation model in either case. <br><br> In general, if the path from a variable to a potential mediator is essentially zero to begin with, save yourself some trouble- there is no reason to test for indirect effects (zero times any value is still zero).

[^time_cause]: Note that if this approach were able to uncover causal relations via statistical means, a blacklist would not be necessary. If you actually tried it here, you'd find adoption status influenced by early adult scholastic abilities.

[^nonrecursiveName]: No, 'non'-recursive as a name for these models makes no sense to me either.

[^CamTriv]: Some of this example comes from Cameron and Trivedi's *Microeconometrics*, which has a pretty clean (in my opinion) depiction of instrumental variable analysis.

[^direct]: In Pearl's language, Z is d-separated from Y if the X -> Y path is removed, but not d-separated from X.  The *d* stands for *directional*.

# Latent Variables

Not everything we want to measure comes with an obvious yardstick.  If one wants to measure something like a person's happiness, what would they have at their disposal? 

- Are they smiling?
- Did they just get a pay raise?
- Are they interacting well with others?
- Are they relatively healthy?


Any of these might be useful as an *indicator* of their current state of happiness, but of course none of them would tell us whether they truly are happy or not. At best, they can be considered imperfect measures. If we consider those and other indicators collectively, perhaps we can get an underlying measure of something we might call happiness, contentment, or some other arbitrary but descriptive name.

Despite how they are typically used within psychology, education and related fields, the use of <span class="emph">latent variable</span> models are actually seen all over, and in ways that may have little to do with what we will be mostly focusing on here[^factcor].  Broadly speaking, <span class='emph'>factor analysis</span> can be seen as a dimension reduction technique, or as an approach to  modeling measurement error and understanding underlying constructs.  We will give some description of the former while focusing on the latter.


## Dimension Reduction/Compression

Many times we simply have the goal of taking a whole lot of variables, reducing them to much fewer, but while retaining as much information about the originals as possible.  For example, this is an extremely common goal in areas of image and audio compression.  Statistical techniques amenable to these approaches are commonly referred to as <span class='emph'>matrix factorization</span>.

### Principal Components Analysis

Probably the most commonly used factor-analytic technique is <span class='emph'>principal components analysis</span> (PCA).  It seeks to extract *components* from a set of variables, with each component containing as much of the original variance as possible.  Components can be seen as a linear combination of the original variables.

PCA works on a covariance/correlation matrix, and it will return as many components as there are variables that go into it, each subsequent component accounting for less variance than the previous component, and summing up to 100% of the total variance in the original data.  With appropriate steps, the components can completely reproduce the original correlation matrix.  However, as the goal is dimension reduction, we only want to retain some of these components, and so the reproduced matrix will not be exact.  This however gives us some sense of a goal to shoot for, and the same idea is also employed in factor analysis/SEM, where we also work with the covariance matrix and prefer models that can closely reproduce the original correlations seen with the observed data.

Visually, we can display PCA as a graphical model. Here is one with four components/variables. The size of the components represents the amount of variance each accounts for.

```

</div>

Let's see an example. The following regards a correlation matrix[^pcafacormat] of 24 psychological tests given to 145 seventh and eight-grade children in a Chicago suburb by Holzinger and Swineford. We'll use the  <span class='pack'>psych</span> package, and to use the <span class="func">principal</span> function, we provide the data (available via the psych package), specify the number of components/factors we want to retain, and other options (in this case, the *rotated* solution will be a little more interpretable[^rotation]).  We will use the <span class="pack">psych</span> package here as it gives us a little more output than standard PCA packages and functions, and one that is more consistent with the factor analysis technique we'll spend time with later.  While we will use lavaan for factor analysis to be consistent with the SEM approach, the psych package is a great tool for standard factor analysis, assessing reliability and other fun stuff.

```{r pca, echo=2:4}
set.seed(1234)
library(psych)
pc = principal(Harman74.cor$cov, nfactors=4,  rotate='varimax')
pc
```

First focus on the last portion of the output where it says `SS loadings` . The first line is the sum of the squared loadings for each  component (in this case where we are using a correlation matrix, summing across all 24 components would equal the value of 24). The `Proportion Var` tells us how much of the overall variance the component accounts for out of all the variables (e.g. `r paste(round(print(pc)$Vaccounted[1], 2), '/', ncol(Harman74.cor$cov), ' = ', round(print(pc)$Vaccounted[1]/ncol(Harman74.cor$cov), 2))`).  The `Cumulative Var` tells us that all 4 components make up over half the variance. The others are the same thing just based on the four components rather than all `r ncol(Harman74.cor$cov)` variables. We can see that each component accounts for a decreasing amount of variance.

<span class='emph'>Loadings</span> in this scenario represent the estimated correlation of an item with its component, and provide the key way in which we interpret the factors. However, we have a lot of them, and rather than interpret that mess in our output, we'll look at it visually. In the following plot, stronger loadings are indicated by blue, and we can see the different variables associated with different components. 

Interpretation is the fun but commonly difficult part. As an example, we can see PC2 as indicative of mathematical ability, but in general this isn't the cleanest result.

```{r pcaLoadings, echo=F, eval=-1, cache=FALSE}
d3heatmap::d3heatmap(pc$loadings)

library(htmltools)
tags$div(style="width:500px; margin-left:auto;  margin-right:auto",
         d3heatmap::d3heatmap(pc$loadings, dendrogram='none',
                              colors=scales::col_bin(RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(11, "RdBu"), domain=c(-1,1), bins=50), width=500)
         )
```

Some explanation of the other parts of the output:

- `h2`: the amount of variance in the item explained by the (retained) components. It is the sum of the squared loadings (a.k.a. <span class="emph">communality</span>).
- `u2`: 1 - h2
- `com`: A measure of complexity. A value of 1 might be seen for something that loaded on only one component, and zero otherwise (a.k.a. perfect simple structure)



We can get a quick graphical model display as follows:

```{r pcaViz, fig.height=5, echo=1, eval=5, cache=FALSE, comment=NA, dev='svg'}
fa.diagram(pc, cex=.5)
sink(file='scripts/pcload.gv')
fa.graph(pc)
unlink('scripts/pcload.gv')
tags$div(style="width:500px; height:500px; margin-left:auto;  margin-right:auto",
         DiagrammeR::DiagrammeR('scripts/pcload.gv', type='grViz', width='500px', height='500px')
)
```

PCA is probably not the best choice in this scenario, nor likely, is a 4 factor solution. One of the primary reasons is that this graphical model assumes the observed variables are measured without error.  In addition, the principal components do not correlate with one another, but it seems likely that we would want to allow the latent variables to do so (a different rotation would allow this).  However, if our goal is merely to reduce the 24 items to a few that account for the most variance, this would be a standard technique.


### Other Matrix Factorization Techniques

Before leaving PCA for factor analysis of the sort we'll mostly be concerned with, I'll mention other matrix factorization techniques that might be of use depending on your data situation.

- **SVD**: singular value decomposition. Works on a raw data matrix rather than covariance matrix, and is still a very viable technique that may perform better in a lot of situations relative to fancier latent variable models, and other more recently developed techniques.  Variations on SVD are behind some recommender systems of the sort you come across at Amazon, Netflix etc.
- **ICA**: Independent components analysis. Extracts non-normal, independent components. The primary goal is to create independent latent variables.
- **Generalized PCA**: PCA techniques for different types of data, e.g. binary data situations.
- **PC Regression**: combining PCA with regression in one model.
- **NMF**: non-negative matrix factorization. Applied to positive valued matrices, produces positive valued factors. Useful, for example, when dealing with counts.
- **LSI**: Latent Semantic Indexing, an early form of topic modeling.
- Many others.



### Factor Analysis

<span class='emph'>Factor analysis</span> is a general technique for uncovering latent variables within data. While initially one might think it similar to PCA[^factpca], one difference from PCA is that the goal is not to recover maximum variance with each factor.    In addition, we will move beyond factor analysis as a dimension reduction technique (and fully 'exploratory' technique, see below), and instead present it as an approach with a potentially strong theoretical underpinning, and one that can help us assess measurement error, ultimately even leading to regression models utilizing the latent variables themselves.


So let us turn to what are typically called <span class="emph">measurement models</span> within SEM. The underlying model can be thought of as a case in which the observed variables, in some disciplines referred to as *indicators* (or *manifest* variables) of the latent construct , are caused by the latent variable. The degree to which the observed variables correlate with one another depends in part on how much of the underlying (presumed) latent variable they reliably measure[^factphil].  

For each indicator we can think of a regression model as follows, where $\beta_0$ is the intercept and $\lambda$ the regression coefficient that expresses the effect of the latent variable $F$ on the observed variable $X$ (I do not note the error).

$$X = \beta_0 + \lambda F$$

We will almost always have multiple indicators, and often multiple latent variables.  Some indicators may be associated with multiple factors.

$$\begin{aligned}
X_1 &= \beta_{01} + \lambda_{11} F_1 + \lambda_{21} F_2 \\
X_2 &= \beta_{02} + \lambda_{12} F_1 + \lambda_{22} F_2 \\
X_3 &= \beta_{03} + \lambda_{13} F_1
\end{aligned}$$


It is important to understand this regression model, because many who engage in factor analysis seemingly do not, and often think of it the other way around, where the observed variables cause the latent.  In factor analysis, the $\lambda$ coefficients are called <span class="emph">loadings</span> (as they were in PCA), but are interpreted as any other regression coefficient- a one unit change in the latent variable results in a $\lambda$ change in the observed variable. Most factor models assume that, controlling for the latent variable, the observed variables are independent (recall our previous discussion on conditional independence in graphical models), though this is sometimes relaxed.  If only one factor is associated with an item and does not correlate with any other factors, then we have a simple regression setting where the standardized coefficient is equal to the correlation between the latent variable and the observed.

#### Exploratory vs. Confirmatory

An unfortunate and unhelpful distinction in some disciplines (esp. psychology) is that of <span class="emph">exploratory</span> vs. <span class="emph">confirmatory</span> factor analysis (and even exploratory SEM).  In any regression analysis, there is a non-zero correlation between *any* variable and some target variable. We don't include everything for theoretical (and even practical) reasons, which is akin to fixing its coefficient to zero, and here it is no different.  Furthermore, most modeling endeavors could be considered exploratory, regardless of how the model is specified.  As such, this distinction doesn't tell us anything about the model, and is thus unnecessary in my opinion.

As an example, in the above equations $X_3$ is not modeled by $F_2$, which is the same as fixing the  $\lambda_{23}$ coefficient for $F2$ to 0. However, that doesn't tell me whether the model is exploratory or not, and yet that is all the distinction refers to, namely, whether we let all factors load with all indicators or not.  An analysis doesn't suddenly have more theoretical weight, validity, causal efficacy, etc. due to the paths specified.

#### Example

Let's see a factor analysis in action.  The motivating example for this section comes from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1997, NLSY97), which investigates the transition from youth to adulthood. For this example, we will investigate a series of questions asked to the participants in 2006 pertaining to the government’s role in promoting well-being. Questions regarded the government's responsibility for the following: providing jobs for everyone, keeping prices under control, providing health care, providing for elderly, helping industry, providing for unemployed, reducing income differences, providing college financial aid, providing decent housing, protecting the environment.  Each item has four values 1:4, which range from 'definitely should be' to 'definitely should not be'[^backward]. We'll save this for the exercise.

There are also three items regarding their emotional well-being (depression)- how often the person felt down or blue, how often they've been a happy person, and how often they've been depressed in the last month. These are also four point scales and range from 'all of the time' to 'none of the time'. We'll use this here.

```{r lavaanFA, eval=-(1:12), echo=-(1:12)}
# conserv  = foreign::read.dta('data/nlsy97cfa.dta')  # data needs to be made useable
# summary(conserv)
# attributes(conserv)$var
# colnames(conserv)[1:14] = c('ID', 'ProvideJobs', 'Prices', 'HealthCare', 'Elderly', 'Industry', 
#                             'Unemployed', 'IncInequal', 'College', 'Housing', 'Environment', 
#                             'FeltDown', 'BeenHappy', 'DepressedLastMonth')
# conservNum = sapply(conserv, as.numeric)
# 
# write.csv(conservNum[,1:11], file='data/nlsy97_governmentNumeric.csv', row.names=F)
# write.csv(conservNum[,c(1,12:14)], file='data/nlsy97_depressedNumeric.csv', row.names=F)

# nlsy = foreign::read.dta('data/nlsy97cfa.dta')          # original; not needed
depressed = read.csv('data/nlsy97_depressedNumeric.csv')

library(lavaan)
modelCode = "
  depressed =~ FeltDown + BeenHappy + DepressedLastMonth
"
famod = cfa(modelCode, data=depressed)
summary(famod, standardized=T)
```

##### Raw results

In a standard measurement model such as this we must *scale the factor* by fixing one of the indicator's loadings to one.  This is done for identification purposes, so that we can estimate the latent variable variance.  Which variable is selected for scaling is arbitrary, but doing so means that the sum of the latent variable variance and the residual variance of the variable whose loading is fixed to one equals the variance of that observed variable[^residualModel].    

```{r plotFARaw, echo=F}
semPlot::semPaths(famod, layout='tree2', style='lisrel', covAtResiduals=F, 
                  whatLabels = 'par', groups=c('latent', 'man'),  color=list(latent='#ff5503', man=scales::alpha('#ff5503',.5)),
                  sizeMan=5, sizeLat=10, edge.label.cex=1.5, borders=F, #edge.color='#1e90ff',
                  label.color='#ffffff', edge.width=2.5) 
```

```{r }
var(depressed$FeltDown, na.rm=T)  # .29 + .15
```


##### Standardized latent variable

An alternative way to scale the latent variable is to simply fix its variance to one (the `std.lv=TRUE` results). It does not need to be estimated, allowing us to obtain loadings for each observed variable.  Again, think of the SLiM setting. The loadings would be  standardized coefficients where the latent construct is the standardized covariate predicting the item of interest.


##### Standardized latent and observed

With both standardized (using the <span class="func">summary</span> function, set `standardized=T`), these loadings represent correlations between the observed and latent variables.  This is the default output in the factor analysis we'd get from non-SEM software (i.e. 'exploratory' FA).  If one is just doing a factor-analytic model, these loadings are typically reported. Standardized coefficients in a CFA are computed by taking the unstandardized coefficient (loading) and multiplying it by the model implied standard deviation of the indicator then dividing by the latent variable’s standard deviation. Otherwise, one can simply use standardized variables in the analysis, or supply only the correlation matrix.

```{r plotFAStd, echo=F}
semPlot::semPaths(famod, layout='tree2', style='lisrel', covAtResiduals=F, 
                  whatLabels = 'std', groups=c('latent', 'man'),  color=list(latent='#ff5503', man=scales::alpha('#ff5503',.5)),
                  sizeMan=5, sizeLat=10, edge.label.cex=1.5, borders=F, #edge.color='#1e90ff',
                  nCharNodes=6, exoVar=T,
                  label.color='#ffffff', edge.width=2.5) 
```

## Constructs and Measurement models

### Scale development

A good use of factor analysis regards scale development.  If we come up with 10 items that reflect some underlying construct, factor analysis can provide a sense of how well the scale is put together.  Recall that in path analysis, residual variance, sometimes called disturbance[^klinedisturbed], reflects both omitted causes as well as measurement error.  In this context, $1-R^2_{item}$ provides a sense of how unreliable the item is.  A perfectly reliable item would be perfectly explained by the construct it is a measure of.  Strong loadings indicate a strong relationship between the item and the underlying construct.

The following diagram shows how the variance breaks down (from Kline). 

<img src="img/uniquevcommon.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto; width:50%">

### Factor Scores

In factor analysis, we can obtain estimated factor scores for each observation, possibly to be used in additional analyses or examined in their own right.  One common way is to simply use the loadings as one would regression weights/coefficients (actually scaled versions of them), and create a 'predicted' factor score as the linear combination of the indicator variables, just as we would in regression.

```{r fscores, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
psychfa = psych::fa(depressed[,-1], 1, scores=T, use='complete')
scores1 = psych::factor.scores(x=na.omit(depressed[,-1]), f=psychfa, method='tenBerge')$scores        # uses regression method
famodstd = cfa(modelCode, depressed[,-1], std.lv = T, std.ov = T, meanstructure = F)
scores2 = predict(famodstd)  # lavaan with standardized data
loads = coef(famodstd)[1:3]                                # raw approach
scores3 = as.matrix(na.omit(depressed[,-1])) %*% solve(cor(depressed[,-1], use='complete')) %*% loads

psych::describe(cbind(na.omit(scores1), scores2, scores3-mean(scores3)))
head(cbind(na.omit(scores1), scores2, scale(scores3, scale=T)))
cor(cbind(na.omit(scores1), scores2, scores3))
```


#### vs. Means/Sums

In many occasions, people reduce the number of variables in a model by using a mean or sum score. These actually can be seen to  reflect an underlying factor analysis where all loadings are fixed to be equal and the residual variance of the observed variables is fixed to zero, i.e. perfect measurement.  If you really think the items reflect a particular construct, you'd probably be better off using a score that comes from a model that doesn't assume perfect measurement.

#### vs. Composites

<span class="emph">Composites</span> scores are what we'd have if we turned the arrows around, and allowed different weights for the different variables, which may not be similar too similar in nature or necessarily correlated (e.g. think of how one might construct a measure of socioeconomic status).  Unlike a simple mean, these would have different weights associated with the items.  PCA is one way one could create such a composite.  Sometimes people just make up weights to use based on what they think they *should* be  (especially in the sporting world). This is silly in my opinion, as I can't think of any reasonable justification for such an approach over the many available.

<img src="img/composite.png" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;"></img>

```{r composite, eval=F, echo=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
# diagrammer package just completely borks here even with an empty graph; code will produce graph, so who knows

## Some Other Uses of Latent Variables

- **EM algorithm**: A very common technique to estimate model parameters for a variety of model situations, it incorporates a latent variable approach where parameters of interest are treated as a latent variable (e.g. probability of belonging to some cluster).

- **Item Response Theory**: uses latent variables, especially in test situations (though is much broader), to assess things like item discrimination, student ability etc.

- **Hidden Markov Model**:  A latent variable model approach commonly used for time series.

- **Topic Model**: In the analysis of text, one can discover latent 'topics' based on the frequency of words.

- **Collaborative Filtering**: For example, in recommender systems for movies or music, the latent variable might represent genre or demographic subsets.



## Summary

Latent variable approaches are a necessary tool to have in your statistical toolbox.  Whether your goal is to compress data or explore underlying theoretically motivated constructs, 'factor-analysis' will serve you well.



## R packages used

- psych
- lavaan




[^factcor]: Some even use use a factor analytic approach to estimating correlations among parameters in models (e.g. I've seen this with gaussian processes and multinomial regression).


[^pcafacormat]: Principal components, standard factor analysis and SEM can work on covariance/correlation matrices even without the raw data, this will be perhaps demonstrated in a later version of this doc.

[^factphil]: There are actually deep philosophical underpinnings to this approach, going at least as far back as the notion of the Platonic forms, and continuing on through philosophical debates about what mental aspects can be measured scientifically. However, even when it became a more quantitative discipline, the philosophy was not far behind. See, for example, [The Vectors of Mind](https://archive.org/details/vectorsofmindmul010122mbp) by L.L. Thurstone, one of the pioneers of measurement theory (1935).  As a philosophy major from back in the day, latent variable modeling has always had great appeal to me.

[^factpca]: One version of factor analysis is nearly identical to PCA in terms of mechanics, save for what are on the diagonals of the correlation matrix (1s for PCA vs. 'communalities' for FA).

[^rotation]: I don't think it necessary to get into rotation here, though will likely add a bit in the future. If you're doing PCA, you're likely not really concerned about interpretation of loadings, as you are going to use the components for other means.  It might help with standard factor analysis, but this workshop will spend time on more focused approaches where one would have some idea of the underlying structure rather than looking to uncover the structure.  Rotation doesn't change anything about the fundamental model result, so one just uses whatever leads to the clearest interpretation.

[^backward]: For your own sake, if you develop a questionnaire, make higher numeric values  correspond to meaning 'more of' something, rather than in this backward fashion.

[^residualModel]: Note that this is actually done for all disturbance/residual terms, as there is an underlying latent variable there which represents measurement error and the effect of unexplained causes.  The path of that latent variable is fixed to 1, and its variance is the residual variance in the SEM output.

[^klinedisturbed]: Kline distinguishes between the residuals in standard regression and disturbance in SEM (p. 131 4th ed.), but the distinction there appears to conflate the estimated variance as a parameter/construct and the actual residuals ($y - \hat{y}$) you'd get after model estimation.  A standard regression as typically estimated is no different than the same model in the graphical modeling context.  Calling path analysis a causal model makes it no more causal than any other regression model, and the remaining variance is the effect of many things not in the model, and they are causal, regardless of estimation technique.  I think we care more deeply about it in the SEM context, and perhaps that necessitates another name, and anything would be better than 'error'.

# Structural Equation Modeling

Structural equation modeling combines the path analytic and latent variable techniques together to allow for regression models among latent and observed variables.  Any model, even the SLiM, can be seen as some form of SEM.  However, the term is typically reserved for the combination of latent and observed variables in a model.

## Measurement model

The <span class="emph">measurement model</span> refers to the latent variable models, i.e. factor analysis, and typical practice in SEM is to investigate these separately and first.  The reason is that one wants to make sure that the measurement model holds before going any further with the underlying constructs. For example, for one's sample of data one might detect two latent variables work better for a set of indicators, or might find that some indicators are performing poorly.

## Structural model

The <span class="emph">structural model</span> specifies the relations among latent and observed variables that do not serve as indicators.  It can become quite complex, but at this stage one can lean on what they were exposed to with path analysis, as conceptually we're in the same place, except now some variables may be latent.

## Example

The following model is a classic example from Wheaton et al. (1977), which used longitudinal data to develop a model of the stability of alienation from 1967 to 1971, accounting for socioeconomic status as a covariate. Each of the three factors have two indicator variables, SES in 1966 is measured by education and occupational status in 1966 and alienation in both years is measured by powerlessness and anomia. The structural component of the model hypothesizes that SES in 1966 influences both alienation in 1967 and 1971 and alienation in 1967 influences the same measure in 1971.  We also let the disturbances correlate from one time point to the next.

The standardized results of the structural model are visualized below, and model results below that. In this case, the structural paths are statistically significant, as is the indirect effect specifically.  Higher socioeconomic status is affiliated with less alienation, while there is a notable positive relationship of prior alienation with later alienation.  We are also accounting for roughly 50% of the variance in 1971 alienation.  Colors represent positive vs. negative weights, and the closer to zero the more faded they are.

```{r wheatonStructural, echo=F}

```{r wheatonResults, echo=FALSE}

```

To be clear, your interpretations based on standard regression still hold here, as the edge parameters are still regression coefficients just like they have always been. It will serve you well in the beginning to interpret each endogenous variable individually as its own model, then move toward the big picture.  Regression with latent variables is the same as regression with observed variables which is the same as a mixture of them.  Correlations, i.e. undirected paths, are still just correlations just like anywhere else.  As for the model fit indices, I will discuss them momentarily and in turn.

## Issues in SEM

### Identification

Identification generally refers to the problem of finding a unique estimate of the value for each parameter in the model. Consider the following:
$$ a + b = 2$$

There is no way for us to determine a unique solution for $a$ and $b$, e.g. the values of 1 and 1 work just as well as -1052 and 1054 and infinite other combinations.  We can talk about 3 basic scenarios, and the problem generally regards how much information we have (in terms of (co)variances) vs. how many parameters we want to estimate in the model.

- A model which has an equal number of observations (again, in terms of (co)variances) and parameters to estimate would have zero degrees of freedom, and is known as a <span class="emph">just identified</span> model. In a just identified model there are no extra degrees of freedom leftover to test model fit. 
- <span class="emph">Underidentified models</span> are models where it is not possible to find a unique estimate for each parameter. These models may have negative degrees of freedom or problematic model structures, as in the example above, and you'll generally know right away there is a problem as whatever software package will note an error, warning, or not provide output.
- <span class="emph">Overidentified models</span> have positive degrees of freedom, meaning there is more than enough pieces of information to estimate each parameter. It is desirable to have overidentified models as it allows us to use other measures of model fit.

Consider the following CFA example in which we try to estimate a latent variable model with only two observed variables, as would be the case in the prior Alienation measurement models if they are examined in isolation. We have only two variances and one covariance to estimate two paths, the latent variable variance and the two residual variances.  By convention, a path is always fixed at 1 to scale the latent variable, but that still leaves us with four parameters to estimate with only three pieces of information, hence the -1 degrees of freedom and other issues in the output.   

```{r identification, echo=-c(1:4,7,9)}
LV = rnorm(100)
x1 = 0 + .5*LV + rnorm(100, sd=sqrt(.75))
x2 = 0 + .7*LV + rnorm(100, sd=sqrt(.5))
x3 = 0 + .9*LV + rnorm(100, sd=sqrt(.2))
modelUnder = 'LV =~ x1 + x2'
modelJust = 'LV =~ x1 + x2 + x3'
library(lavaan)
underModel = cfa(modelUnder, data=cbind(x1,x2,x3))
semPlot::semPaths(underModel, style='lisrel', 
                  exoVar=T, edge.label.cex=1, 
                  borders=F, color='#ff5503', label.color='#ffffff')
summary(underModel)
```

Now if we had a third manifest variable, we now have six pieces of information to estimate and still seven unknowns. Again though, we usually fix the first loading to 1, so it would be estimated. An alternative approach would be to fix the factor variance to some value (typically 1 to create a standardized latent variable). This will allow us to estimate a unique value for each path.

Even so, this is the *just identified* situation, and so the model runs, but we won't have any fit measures because we can perfectly reproduce the observed correlation matrix.

```{r justID, echo=-2}
justModel = cfa(modelJust, data=cbind(x1,x2,x3))
semPlot::semPaths(justModel, style='lisrel', 
                  exoVar=T, edge.label.cex=1, 
                  borders=F, color='#ff5503', label.color='#ffffff')
summary(justModel, fit=T)
```

Note that in the full alienation model, we have 6*7/2 = 21 variances and covariances, which provides enough to estimate the parameters of the model.


Determining identification is difficult for any complex model. Necessary conditions include there being model degrees of freedom $\geq 0$, and scaling all latent variables, but they are not sufficient. In general though, it is enough to know conceptually what the issue is and how the information you have relates to what you can estimate.

### Fit

There are many, many measures of model fit for SEM, and none of them will give you a definitive answer as to how your model is doing.  Your assessment, if you use them, is to take a holistic approach to get a global sense of how your model is doing.  Let's look again at the alienation results.

```{r fitMeasures}
fitMeasures(alienation, c('chisq', 'df', 'pvalue', 'cfi', 'rmsea', 'srmr', 'AIC'))
```


#### Chi-square test

Conceptually the $\chi^2$ test measures the discrepancy between the observed correlations and those implied by the model.  In the [graphical model section](#path-analysis), we actually gave an example of reproducing a correlation from a path analysis. In general, the model goal is to reproduce them as closely as we can.  It compares the fitted model with a (saturated) model that does not have any degrees of freedom. The degrees of freedom for this test are equal to the data (variances + covariances) minus the number of parameters estimated.  A non-significant $\chi^2$ suggests our predictions are not statistically different from those we observe, so yay!

```{r chisqOutput, echo=F}
cat(
'  Estimator                                         ML
  Minimum Function Test Statistic                4.735
  Degrees of freedom                                 4
  P-value (Chi-square)                           0.316
'
)
```


**Or not**.  Those familiar with null-hypothesis testing know that one cannot accept a null hypothesis, and attempting to do so is fundamentally illogical.    Other things that affect this measure specifically include multivariate non-normality, the size of the correlations (larger ones are typically related to larger predicted vs. observed discrepancies), unreliable measures (can actually make this test fail to reject), and sample size (same as with any other model scenario and statistical significance).

So if it worries you that a core measure of model fit in SEM is fundamentally problematic, good. As has been said before, no single measure will be good enough on its own, so gather as much info as you can.  Some suggest to pay more attention to the $\chi^2$ result, but to me, the flawed logic is something that can't really be overcome.  If you use it with appropriate null hypothesis testing logic, a significant $\chi^2$ test can tell you that something is potentially wrong with the model.


- Note that <span class="pack">lavaan</span> also provides a Chi-square test which compares the current model to a model in which all paths are zero, and is essentially akin to the likelihood ratio test we might use in standard model settings (e.g. comparing against an intercept only model).  For that test, we want a statistically significant result.  However, one can specify a prior model conducted with <span class="pack">lavaan</span> to test against specifically (i.e. to compare nested models).

#### CFI etc.

The comparative fit index compares the fitted model to a null model that assumes there is no relationship among the measured items. CFI values larger than .9 or especially .95 are desired. Others include the Tucker-Lewis Fit Index, which is provided in standard <span class="pack">lavaan</span> output, but there are more <span class="emph">incremental fit indices</span> where those come from.

```{r cfioutput, echo=FALSE}
cat('User model versus baseline model:

  Comparative Fit Index (CFI)                    1.000
  Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI)                       0.999'
)
```


#### RMSEA

The root mean squared error of approximation is a measure that also centers on the model-implied vs. sample covariance matrix, and, all else being equal, is lower for simpler models and larger sample sizes. Look for values less than .05.  <span class="pack">Lavaan</span> also provides a one-sided test that the RMSE is $\leq .05$, which ideally would be high, but the confidence interval is enough for reporting purposes.

```{r rmseaoutput, echo=FALSE}
cat('Root Mean Square Error of Approximation:

  RMSEA                                          0.014
  90 Percent Confidence Interval          0.000  0.053
  P-value RMSEA <= 0.05                          0.930

Standardized Root Mean Square Residual:

  SRMR                                           0.007')
```


#### SRMR

The standardized root mean squared residual is the mean absolute correlation residual, i.e. the difference between the observed and model-implied correlations. Historical suggestions are to also look for values less than .05, but it is better to simply inspect the residuals and note where there are large discrepancies.

```{r corResiduals}
residuals(alienation, type='cor')$cor
```

Like many matrices, it doesn't take much to where it can be difficult to discern patterns unless one takes a visual approach.  Perhaps consider <span class="pack">d3heatmap</span> (examples throughout this document) or <span class="pack">corrplot</span> packages.


#### Fit Summarized

A brief summary of these and other old/typical measures of fit are described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmatory_factor_analysis#Evaluating_model_fit).  However they all have issues, and one should *never* use cutoffs as a basis for your ultimate thinking about model performance.  Studies have been done and all the fit indices can potentially have problems in various scenarios, and the cutoffs commonly used by applied researchers do not hold up under scrutiny.  While they can provide some assistance in the process, they are not meant to overcome a global assessment of theory-result compatibility.

### Model Comparison

All of the above, while rooted in model comparison approaches, are by themselves only providing information about the fit or lack thereof regarding the current model.  In any modeling situation, SEM or otherwise, a model comparison approach is to be preferred.  Even when we don't have the greatest model, being able to choose among viable options can help science progress.

#### AIC

AIC is a good way to compare models in SEM just as it is elsewhere, where a penalty is imposed on the likelihood based on the number of parameters estimated, i.e. model complexity.  The value by itself is not useful, but the 'better' model will have a lower value. A natural question arises as to how low is low enough to prefer one model over another, but this is impossible to answer because the value of AIC varies greatly with the data and model in question. However, this frees you to know which is 'better', at least in terms of AIC, while still allowing you to consider the relative merits of the models being considered.  However, if the lower AIC is associated with the simpler model, you'd be hard-pressed to justify not taking it.  

#### BIC

One can probably ignore the BIC in this context. This isn't actually Bayesian, and if you were using a Bayesian approach, WAIC or DIC would be appropriate.  If you aren't using a Bayesian approach, then AIC would likely be preferable in most circumstances.  The BIC has a different penalty than AIC, and is not a measure based on predictive performance, which is what we typically want in model selection.

#### Example

Let's compare the previous model to one without the indirect effect and in which the SES and Alienation contributions are independent (i.e. just make the previous code change to `alien67 ~ 0*ses`).  We'll use the <span class="pack">semTools</span> package for easy side by side comparison.


```{r wheatModComparison, echo=F, results='hide'}
# the model
wheaton.model2 <- '
  # measurement model
    ses     =~ education + sei
    alien67 =~ anomia67 + powerless67
    alien71 =~ anomia71 + powerless71
 
  # equations
    alien71 ~ alien67 + ses
    alien67 ~ 0*ses
 
  # correlated residuals
    # ses ~~ 0*alien67
    anomia67 ~~ anomia71
    powerless67 ~~ powerless71
'
 
alienationNoInd <- sem(wheaton.model2, sample.cov=wheaton.cov, sample.nobs=932)
library(semTools)
compfit = summary(compareFit(alienation, alienationNoInd))
```

```{r compareFits, eval=-2, echo=-(3:5)}
library(semTools)
compareFit(alienation, alienationNoInd)
cat('################### Nested Model Comparison #########################
                                chi df      p delta.cfi
alienation - alienationNoInd 200.28  1  <.001    0.0941')

pander::pander(compfit, split.table=Inf)
```

The first result is a likelihood ratio test. The model with no path is nested within the model with a path and so this is a viable option.  It tells us essentially that adding the indirect path results in a statistically significantly better model. In terms of fit indices, the model including the indirect effect appears to fit the data well (note that the .000 is actually 1.00), while the other model does not.  So now we can say that not only does our model appear to fit the data well, but is better than a plausible competitor.


### Prediction

While the fitted correlation matrix is nice to be able to obtain, it has always struck me a bit odd that one can't even predict the actual data with typical SEM software.  Part of this is due to the fact that the models regard the covariance matrix as opposed to the raw data, and that is the focus in many SEM situations. But in path analysis, measurement models, and SEM where mean structures are of focus (e.g. growth curves), it stands to reason that one would like to get predicted values and/or be able to test a model on new data. Even in more complex models, predictions can be made by fixing parameters at estimated values and supplying new data.

<span class="pack">Lavaan</span> at least does do this for you, and its <span class="func">lavPredict</span> function allows one to get predicted values for both latent and observed variables, for the current or new data.  In addition, the <span class="pack">semTools</span> package is a great resource for comparing models generally, comparing models across groups, model simulation and so forth.

### Observed covariates

While I would hope it is by now, just to be clear, SEM doesn't only have to be about structural relations among latent variables.  At any point observed covariates can be introduced to the structural model as well, and this is common practice.  As an example, the alienation model is fundamentally wrong (from a causal perspective if that's of particular interest), as it doesn't include many background or other characteristics we'd commonly collect on individuals and which might influence feelings of alienation.


### Interactions

Interactions among both observed and latent variables can be included in SEM, and have the same interpretation as they would in any regression model.  As noted previously, a common term for this in SEM terminology is <span class="emph">moderation</span>.  While many depictions in SEM suggest that one variable *moderates* another, just like with standard interactions it is arbitrary whether one says **A** interacts with/moderates **B** or vice versa, and this fact doesn't change just because we are conducting an SEM.  For latent variables, one can think of adding a latent variable whose indicator variables consists of product terms of the indicators for the latent variables we want to have an interaction. See <span class="func">indProd</span> and <span class="func">probe2WayMC</span> in the <span class="pack">semTools</span> package.


### Estimation

In everything demonstrated thus far, we have been using standard maximum likelihood to estimate the parameters.  This often may not be the best choice. The following list comes from the MPlus manual, and most of these are available in <span class="pack">lavaan</span>.

- **ML**: maximum likelihood parameter estimates with conventional standard errors and chi-square test statistic
- **MLM**: maximum likelihood parameter estimates with standard errors and a mean-adjusted chi-square test statistic that are robust to non-normality. The chi-square test statistic is also referred to as the Satorra-Bentler chi-square.
- **MLMV**: maximum likelihood parameter estimates with standard errors and a mean- and variance-adjusted chi-square test statistic that are robust to non-normality
- **MLR**: maximum likelihood parameter estimates with standard errors and a chi-square test statistic (when applicable) that are robust to non-normality and non-independence of observations when used with TYPE=COMPLEX. The MLR standard errors are computed using a sandwich estimator. The MLR chi-square test statistic is asymptotically equivalent to the Yuan-Bentler T2* test statistic.
- **MLF**: maximum likelihood parameter estimates with standard errors approximated by first-order derivatives and a conventional chi-square test statistic
- **MUML**: Muthén’s limited information parameter estimates, standard errors, and chi-square test statistic
- **WLS**: weighted least square parameter estimates with conventional standard errors and chi-square test statistic that use a full weight matrix. The WLS chi-square test statistic is also referred to as ADF when all outcome variables are continuous.
- **WLSM**: weighted least square parameter estimates using a diagonal weight matrix with standard errors and mean-adjusted chi-square test statistic that use a full weight matrix
- **WLSMV**: weighted least square parameter estimates using a diagonal weight matrix with standard errors and mean- and variance-adjusted chi-square test statistic that use a full weight matrix
- **ULS**: unweighted least squares parameter estimates
- **ULSMV**: unweighted least squares parameter estimates with standard errors and a mean- and variance-adjusted chi-square test statistic that use a full weight matrix
- **GLS**: generalized least square parameter estimates with conventional standard errors and chi-square test statistic that use a normal-theory based weight matrix
- **Bayes**: Bayesian posterior parameter estimates with credibility intervals and posterior predictive checking[^bayesEstimator]


### Missing data

A lot of data of interest in applications of SEM have missing values.  Two common approaches to dealing with this are <span class="emph">Full Information Maximum Likelihood</span> (FIML) and <span class="emph">Multiple Imputation</span> (MI), and both are generally available in SEM packages.  This is far too detailed an issue to treat adequately here, though we can take a moment to describe the approach generally.  FIML uses the available information in the data (think pairwise correlations). MI uses a process to estimate the raw data values, and to adequately account for the uncertainty in those guesses, it creates multiple versions of complete data sets, each with different estimates of the missing values.  The SEM model is run on all of them and estimates combined across all models (e.g. the mean path parameter).  The imputation models, i.e. those used to estimate the missing values, can be any sort of regression model, including using variables not in the SEM model.

In addition, Bayesian approaches can estimate the missing values as additional parameters in the model (in fact, MI is essentially steeped within a Bayesian perspective).  Also there may additional concerns when data is missing over time, i.e. longitudinal dropout.  Using the <span class="pack">lavaan</span> package is nice because it comes with FIML, and the <span class="pack">semTools</span> package adds MI.

### Other SEM approaches

SEM is very flexible and applicable to a wide variety of modeling situations.  Some of these will be covered in their own module (e.g. mixture models, growth curve modeling).


## How to fool yourself with SEM

Kline's third edition text listed over 50(!) ways in which one could fool themselves with SEM, which speaks to the difficulty in running SEM and dealing with all of its issues.  I will note a handful of some of them to keep in mind in particular.

### Sample size

If you don't have at least a thousand observations, you will probably only be able to conduct (possibly unrealistically) simple SEM models, or just the measurement models for scale development, or only structural models with observed variables (path analysis).  Even with simpler modeling situations, one should have several hundred observations.  In the simple alienation model above, we already are dealing with 17 parameters to estimate, and it doesn't include any background covariates of the individuals, which is unrealistic.  Furthermore, because it's a mediation model, adding such variables might require additional direct and indirect paths, time-varying covariates that would have effects at both years, etc., and the number of parameters could balloon quite quickly.

One will see many articles of published research with low sample sizes using SEM.  This doesn't make it correct to do so, and one should be highly suspicious of the results suggested in those papers, as they are overfit or not including relevant information.

### Poor data

If the correlations among the data are low, one isn't going to magically have strong effects by using SEM.  I have seen many clients running these models and who are surprised that they don't turn out well, when a quick glance at the correlation matrix would have suggested that there wasn't much to work with in the first place. 

### Naming a latent variable doesn't mean it exists

While everything may turn out well for one's measurement model, and the results in keeping with theory, this doesn't make it so.  This is especially the case with less reliable measures. Latent constructs require operational definitions and other considerations in order to be useful, and rule out that one isn't simply measuring something else, or that it makes sense that such a construct has real (physical ties).

As an example, many diagnoses in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders have not even been shown to exist via a statistical approach like SEM[^dsm], while others are simply assumed to exist, and even presumably (subsequently) supported by measurement models (often with low N), only to be shown to have no ties to any underlying physiology.

### Ignoring diagnostics

Ignoring residuals, warning messages, etc. is a sure path to trying to interpret nonsensical results.  Look at your residuals, fitted values etc. If your SEM software of choice is giving you messages, find out what they mean, because it may be very important.

### Ignoring performance

As in our previous path analysis example, one can write a paper on a good fitting model with statistically significant results, and not explain the targets of interest very well on a practical level. Check things like R-square (and accuracy if binary targets) when running your models.

## Summary

SEM is a powerful modeling approach that generalizes many other techniques, but it simply cannot be used lightly. Strong theory, strong data, and a lot of data can potentially result in quite interesting models that have a lot to say about the underlying constructs of interest.  Go into it with competing ideas, and realize that your theory is wrong from the outset, even if there is evidence that it isn't way off.

# Latent Growth Curves

<span class="emph">Latent growth curve (LGC)</span> models are in a sense, just a different form of the very commonly used <span class="emph">mixed model</span> framework.  In some ways they are more flexible, mostly in the standard structural equation modeling framework that allows for indirect, and other complex covariate relationships.  In other ways, they are less flexible (e.g. requiring balanced data, estimating nonlinear relationships, data with many time points, dealing with time-varying covariates).  With appropriate tools there is little one can't do with the normal mixed model approach relative to the SEM approach, and one would likely have easier interpretation.  As such I'd recommend sticking with the standard mixed model framework unless you really need to.

That said, growth curve models are a very popular SEM technique, so it makes sense to become familiar with them. To best understand a growth curve model, I still think it's instructive to see it from the mixed model perspective, where things are mostly interpretable from what you know from a SLiM.


## Random effects

Often data is clustered, e.g. students within schools or observations for individuals over time.  The standard linear model assumes *independent* observations, and in these situations we definitely do not have that.

One very popular way to deal with these are a class of models called <span class="emph">mixed effects models</span>, or simply mixed models.  They are mixed, because there is a mixture of <span class="emph">fixed effects</span> and <span class="emph">random effects</span>.  The fixed effects are the regression coefficients one has in standard modeling approaches.

The *random effects* allow each cluster to have its own unique effect in addition to the overall fixed effect.  This is simply a random deviation, almost always normally distributed in practice, from the overall intercept and slopes.  Mixed models are a balanced approach between ignoring these unique contributions, and over-contextualizing by running separate regressions for every cluster.

### Model formality

The following depicts a mixed model from a multilevel modeling context, which is just using a mixed model with possibly multiply nested grouping structures.  The cluster that produce the random effects do not have to be hierarchical however, we just use the depiction here as it may be easier than the matrix approach.  

As an example, consider the case of repeated measures within an individual or individuals clustered within a geographic region. To model some target variable $y$, within a group/cluster, each observation $i$ in that cluster $c$, will have a cluster specific intercept:

$$y_{i} = b_{0c} + b_1*X_i + e_i$$

At this point it looks like a standard regression, and is conceptually.  In addition, the cluster specific intercepts have overall means (the fixed effect) plus some cluster specific deviation (random effect).  These two can be thought of as additional regression models for the intercepts and slopes.

$$b_{0c} = b_0 + u_c$$


These random effects $u$ are typically assumed normally distributed with some standard deviation, just like our 'error'.

$$u_c \sim N(0, \tau)$$

$$e_i \sim N(0, \sigma)$$


Plugging in the cluster level model to the initial model, we get the following:

$$y_{i} = [b_0 + u_c] + b1 * X_i + e_i$$


This is where the notion of 'random coefficients' comes from.  We also might display the model as follows:

$$y_{i} = b_0 + b_1 * X_i  + [u_c + e_i]$$

Now the focus is on a standard regression model with an additional source of variance.

This is just one depiction, we might allow the slope to vary also, have random effects from multiple clustering sources, cluster level covariates, allow the random intercepts and slopes to correlate, and a host of other interesting approaches.  The goal here is to keep things within the standard regression context as much as possible.


## Random Effects in SEM

As we've seen with other models, the latent variables are assumed normally distributed, usually with zero mean, and some estimated variance.  Well so are the random effects in mixed models, and it's through this that we can maybe start to get a sense of random effects as latent variables (or vice versa).  Indeed, mixed models have ties to many other kinds of models (e.g. spatial, additive), because they too add a 'random' component to the model in some fashion.


## Simulating Random Effects

Through simulation we can demonstrate conceptual understanding of mixed models, and be well on our way toward better understanding LGC models.  We'll have balanced data, with scores across four time-points for 500 individuals (subjects).  We will only investigate the trend ('growth'), and allow subject-specific intercepts and slopes.

set.seed(1234)
n = 500
timepoints = 4
time = rep(0:3, times=n)
subject = rep(1:n, each=4)
```


We'll have 'fixed' effects, i.e. our standard regression intercept and slope, set at .5 and .25 respectively.  We'll allow their associated subject-specific intercept and slope to have a slight correlation (.2), and as such we'll draw them from a multivariate normal distribution (variance of 1 for both effects).

```{r createSimData}
intercept = .5
slope = .25
randomEffectsCorr = matrix(c(1,.2,.2,1), ncol=2) 
randomEffects = MASS::mvrnorm(n, mu=c(0,0), Sigma = randomEffectsCorr, empirical=T) %>% 
  data.frame()
colnames(randomEffects) = c('Int', 'Slope')
```

Let's take a look at the data thus far. Note how I'm using subject as a row index.  This will spread out the n random effects to n*timepoints total, while being constant within a subject.

```{r inspectSimData, echo=FALSE}
library(DT)
data.frame(Subject=subject, time=time, randomEffects[subject,]) %>% 
  datatable() %>% formatRound(~Int+Slope, 4)
```

Now, to get a target variable, we simply add the random effects for the intercept to the overall intercept, and likewise for the slopes. We'll throw in some noise at the end with standard deviation equal to $\sigma$.

```{r createSimTarget}
sigma = .5
y1 = (intercept + randomEffects$Int[subject]) + (slope + randomEffects$Slope[subject])*time + rnorm(n*timepoints, mean=0, sd=sigma)

d = data.frame(subject, time, y1)
```

```{r inspectSimData2, echo=FALSE}
datatable(d) %>% formatRound(~y1, 4)
```


Let's estimate this as a mixed model first[^reml] using the <span class="pack">lme4</span> package. See if you can match the parameters from our simulated data to the output.

```{r mixedModel, echo=1:3, eval=c(1:2,4)}
library(lme4)
mixedModel = lmer(y1 ~ time + (1 + time|subject), data=d)  # 1 represents the intercept
summary(mixedModel)
summary(mixedModel, correlation=F)
```

Our fixed effects are at the values we set for the overall intercept and slope.  The estimated random effects variances are at 1, the correlation near .2, and finally, our residual standard deviation is near the .5 value we set.


## Running a Growth Curve Model

As before, we'll use <span class="pack">lavaan</span>, but now the syntax will look a bit strange compared to what we're used to with our prior SEM, because we have to fix the factor loadings to specific values in order to make it work.  This also leads to non-standard output relative to other SEM models, as there is nothing to estimate for the many fixed parameters.  Furthermore, our data needs to be in *wide* format, where each row represents a person, as opposed to the *long* format we used in the previous mixed model.  We can use <span class="pack">tidyr</span> to help with that.

```{r wideData, echo=-1}
head(d)
library(tidyr)
dWide = d %>%  
  spread(time, y1)
head(dWide)

# change the names, as usually things don't work well if they start with a number
colnames(dWide)[-1] = paste0('y', 0:3)
```

Now we're ready to run the model. Note that <span class="pack">lavaan</span> has a specific function, <span class="func">growth</span>, to use for these models.  It doesn't spare us any effort for the model syntax, but does make it unnecessary to set various things with the <span class="func">sem</span> function. 

```{r runGrowth}
model = "
    # intercept and slope with fixed coefficients
    i =~ 1*y0 + 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3
    s =~ 0*y0 + 1*y1 + 2*y2 + 3*y3
"

growthCurveModel = growth(model, data=dWide)
summary(growthCurveModel)
```

Most of the output is blank, which is needless clutter, but we do get the same five parameter values we are interested in though.

Start with the 'intercepts':

```{}
Intercepts:
                   Estimate  Std.Err  Z-value  P(>|z|)
                       
    i                 0.487    0.048   10.072    0.000
    s                 0.267    0.045    5.884    0.000
```

It might be odd to call your fixed effects 'intercepts', but it makes sense if we are thinking of it as a multilevel model as depicted previously, where we actually broke out the random effects as a separate model. The estimates here are pretty much spot on with our mixed model estimates, which are identical to just the standard regression estimates.

```{r fixefs}
fixef(mixedModel)
lm(y1 ~ time, data=d)
```

Now let's look at the variance estimates.  The estimation of residual variance for each y in the LGC distinguishes the two approaches, but not necessarily so.  We could fix them to be identical here, or conversely allow them to be estimated in the mixed model framework.  Just know that's why the results are not identical (to go along with their respective estimation approaches, which are also different by default).  Again though, the variances are near one, and the correlation between the intercepts and slopes is around the .2 value.

```{}
Covariances:
                   Estimate  Std.Err  Z-value  P(>|z|)
  i ~~                                                
    s                 0.226    0.050    4.512    0.000
Variances:
                   Estimate  Std.Err  Z-value  P(>|z|)
    y0                0.287    0.041    6.924    0.000
    y1                0.219    0.021   10.501    0.000
    y2                0.185    0.027    6.748    0.000
    y3                0.357    0.065    5.485    0.000
    i                 0.977    0.076   12.882    0.000
    s                 0.969    0.065   14.841    0.000
```

```{r ranefVAr}
VarCorr(mixedModel)
```


The differences provide some insight.  LGC by default assumes heterogeneous variance for each time point. Mixed models by default assume the same $\sigma^2$ for each time point, but can allow them to be estimated separately in most modeling packages.

As an example, if we fix the variances to be equal, the models are now identical. 

```{r compareMixedLGC, results='hold'}
model = "
    # intercept and slope with fixed coefficients
    i =~ 1*y0 + 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3
    s =~ 0*y0 + 1*y1 + 2*y2 + 3*y3

    y0 ~~ resvar*y0    
    y1 ~~ resvar*y1
    y2 ~~ resvar*y2
    y3 ~~ resvar*y3
"

growthCurveModel = growth(model, data=dWide)
summary(growthCurveModel)
```

Compare to the <span class="pack">lme4</span> output.

```{r compareVar, echo=F}
print(VarCorr(mixedModel), comp='Var')
```


In addition, the random coefficients estimates from the mixed model perfectly correlate with those of the latent variables.

```{r compareRandomeffects, echo=FALSE}
ranefLatent = data.frame(coef(mixedModel)[[1]], lavPredict(growthCurveModel)) %>% 
  rename(Int_mix = X.Intercept.,
         Slope_mix = time,
         Int_lgc = i,
         Slope_lgc = s)
ranefLatent %>%   round(2) %>% head
ranefLatent %>% cor %>% round(2)
```

Both approaches allow those residuals to covary, though it gets tedious in SEM syntax, while it is a natural extension in the mixed model framework. Here is the syntax for letting each time point covary with the next, at least, what it might be. It's unclear if lavaan actually will do this, and the syntax here roughly follows MPlus' manual, except that we can't define new variables in lavaan as there.  As such, the hope is that the `a` parameter should equal `resvar*corr` as in the MPlus syntax, but there's not a clear way to fix it to be.  It seems consistent here and with larger sample sizes.

```{r, echo=1}
model = "
    # intercept and slope with fixed coefficients
    i =~ 1*y0 + 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3
    s =~ 0*y0 + 1*y1 + 2*y2 + 3*y3


    # all of the following is needed for what are essentially only two parameters 
    # to estimate- resvar and correlation (the latter defined explicitly here)
    y0 ~~ resvar*y0
    y1 ~~ resvar*y1
    y2 ~~ resvar*y2
    y3 ~~ resvar*y3

    # timepoints 1 step apart; technically the covariance is e.g. a*sqrt(y0)*sqrt(y1), 
    # but since the variances are constrained to be equal, we don't have to be so verbose.
    y0 ~~ a*y1
    y1 ~~ a*y2
    y2 ~~ a*y3
    
    # two steps apart
    y0 ~~ b*y2
    y1 ~~ b*y3
    
    # three steps apart
    y0 ~~ c*y3
    
    # fix parameters according to ar1
    b == a^2
    c == a^3
"
gcOut = growth(model, data=dWide)
summary(gcOut, standardized=T)

library(nlme)
lmeOut = lme(y1 ~ time, random= ~1 + time|subject, data=d, correlation=corAR1(form=~ time | subject), method='ML')
summary(lmeOut, correlation=F)  # compare Residual StdDev to resvar^.5, and phi to 'a/resvar' or std.all 'a' from lavaan
```

```{r brmcomparison, echo=FALSE, eval=F}
test = brm(y1 ~ time + (1+time|subject), d, cores=4)
test = brm(y1 ~ time + (1+time|subject), autocor = cor_ar(~time|subject), data= d, cores=4)
summary(test)
```



## Thinking more generally about regression

In fact, your standard regression is already equipped to handle heterogeneous variances and a specific correlation structure for the residuals. The linear model can be depicted as the following:

$$y \sim N(X\beta, \Sigma)$$

$X\beta$ represents the linear predictor, i.e. the linear combination of your predictors, and a big, N by N covariance matrix $\Sigma$.  Thus the target variable $y$ is multivariate normal with mean vector $X\beta$ and covariance $\Sigma$.

SLiMs assume that the covariance matrix is constant diagonal.  A single value on the diagonal, $\sigma^2$, and zeros on the off-diagonals.  Mixed models, and other approaches as well, can allow the covariance structure to be specified in myriad ways, and it ties them to still other models, which in the end produces a very flexible modeling framework.



## More on LGC

### LGC are non-standard SEM

In no other SEM situation are you likely to fix so many parameters or think about your latent variables in this manner.  This can make for difficult interpretations relative to the mixed model (unless you are aware of the parallels).

### Residual correlations

Typical models that would be investigated via the LGC have correlated residuals as depicted above.

### Nonlinear time effect

A nonlinear time effect can be estimated if we don't fix all the parameters for the slope factor. As an example, the following would actually estimate the loadings for times in between the first and last point.

```{r nonlinearTime, eval=FALSE}
    s =~ 0*y0 + y1 + y2 + 1*y3
```

It may be difficult to assess nonlinear relationships unless one has many time points[^nonlinearfewtimepts], and even then, one might get more with an additive mixed model approach.

### Growth Mixture Models

Adding a latent categorical variable would allow for different trajectories across the latent groups.  Most clients that I've seen typically did not have enough data to support it, as one essentially can be estimating a whole growth model for each group. Some might restrict certain parameters for certain groups, but given that the classes are a latent construct to be discovered, there would not be a theoretical justification to do so, and it would only complicate interpretation at best.  Researchers rarely if ever predict test data, nor provide evidence that the clusters hold up with alternate data.  In addition, it seems that typical interpretation of the classes takes on an ordered structure (e.g. low, medium, and high), which means they just have a coarsely measured continuous latent variable.  In other cases, the groups actually reflect intact groups represented by covariates they have not included in the data (or perhaps are an interaction of those).  Had they started under the assumption of a continuous latent variable, it might have made things easier to interpret and estimate.

As of this writing, MPlus is perhaps the only SEM software used for these <span class="emph">Growth Mixture Models</span>, and it requires yet another syntax style, and, depending on the model you run, some of the most confusing output you'll ever see in SEM.  Alternatives in R include <span class="pack">flexmix</span> (demonstrated in the Mixture Models Module) for standard mixture modeling (including mixed effects models), as well as the R package <span class="pack">OpenMx</span>.


### Other covariates

#### Cluster level

To add a <span class="emph">cluster-level covariate</span>, for a mixed model, it looks something like this:

*standard random intercept*

$$y = b_{0c} + b1*\mathrm{time} + e $$
$$b_{0c} = b_0 + u_c$$   

Plugging in becomes:
$$y = b_0 + b1*\mathrm{time} + u_c + e $$

*subject level covariate added*

$$b_{0c} = b_0 + c1*\mathrm{sex} + u_c$$ 

But if we plug that into our level 1 model, it just becomes:
$$y = b_0 + c1*\mathrm{sex} + b1*\mathrm{time} + u_c + e$$

In our previous modeling syntax it would look like this:

```{r clusterLevelVar, eval=F}
mixedModel = lmer(y1 ~ sex + time + (time|subject), data=d)
```

We'd have a fixed effect for sex and interpret it just like in the standard setting. Similarly, if we had a time-varying covariate, say socioeconomic status, it'd look like the following:
```{r timevaryingVar, eval=F}
mixedModel = lmer(y1 ~ time + ses + (time|subject), data=d)
```

Though we could have a random slope for SES if we wanted.  You get the picture. Most of the model is still standard regression interpretation.

With LGC, there is a tendency to interpret the model as an SEM, and certainly one can.  But adding additional covariates typically causes confusion for those not familiar with mixed models.  We literally do have to regress the intercept and slope latent variables on cluster level covariates as follows.

```{r lgcClutersLevelVar}
model.syntax <- '
  # intercept and slope with fixed coefficients
    i =~ 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3 + 1*y4
    s =~ 0*y1 + 1*y2 + 2*y3 + 3*y4

  # regressions
    i ~ x1 + x2
    s ~ x1 + x2
'
```

Applied researchers commonly have difficulty on interpreting the model due to past experience with SEM.  While these are latent variables, they aren't *just* latent variables or underlying constructs.  It doesn't help that the output can be confusing, because now one has an 'intercept for your intercepts' and an 'intercept for your slopes'. In the multilevel context it makes sense, but there you know 'intercept' is just 'fixed effect'.



#### Time-varying covariates

With <span class="emph">time varying covariates</span>, i.e. those that can have a different value at each time point, the syntax starts to get tedious.  Here we add just one such covariate, $c$.

```{r lgcTimeVar, eval=F}
model.syntax <- '
  # intercept and slope with fixed coefficients
    i =~ 1*y1 + 1*y2 + 1*y3 + 1*y4
    s =~ 0*y1 + 1*y2 + 2*y3 + 3*y4

  # regressions
    i ~ x1 + x2
    s ~ x1 + x2

  # time-varying covariates
    y1 ~ c1
    y2 ~ c2
    y3 ~ c3
    y4 ~ c4
'
fit <- growth(model.syntax, data=Demo.growth)
summary(fit)
```

Now imagine having just a few of those kinds of variables. In the mixed model framework one would add them in as any covariate in a regression model, and each covariate would be associated with a single fixed effect. In the LGC framework, one has to regress each time point for the target variable on its corresponding predictor time point.  It might take a few paragraphs to explain the coefficients for just a handful of covariates.



## Some Differences between Mixed Models and Growth Curves



### Random slopes

One difference seen in comparing LGC models vs. mixed models is that in the former, random slopes are always assumed, whereas in the latter, one would typically see if it's worth adding random slopes in the first place, or simply not assume them.

### Wide vs. long

The SEM framework is inherently multivariate, and your data will need to be in wide format.  This isn't too big of a deal until you have many time-varying covariates, then the model syntax is tedious and you end up having the number of parameters to estimate climb rapidly.

### Sample size

As we have noted before, SEM is inherently a large sample technique.  The growth curve model does not require as much for standard approaches, but may require a lot more depending on the model one tries to estimate.  In my own simulations, haven't seen too much difference compared to mixed models even for notably small sample sizes, but those were for very simple models.

### Number of time points

A basic growth curve model requires four time points to incorporate the flexibility that would make it worthwhile.  Mixed models don't have the restriction (outside of the obvious need of two).

### Balance

Mixed models can run even if some clusters have a single value. SEM requires balanced data and so one will always have to estimate missing values or drop them.  Whether this missingness can be ignored in the standard mixed model framework is a matter of some debate in certain circles.

### Numbering the time points

Numbering your time from zero makes sense in both worlds.  This leads to the natural interpretation that the intercept is the mean for your first time point.  In other cases having a centered value would make sense, or numbering from 0 to a final value of 1, which would mean the slope coefficient represents the change over the whole time span.


## Other stuff

In the [appendix][# Parallel Process Example] I provide an example of a parallel process in which we posit two growth curves at the same time, with possible correlations among them. This could be accomplished quite easily with a standard mixed model in the Bayesian framework, with a multivariate response, though I'll have to come back to that later.  

## Summary

Growth curve modeling is an alternate way to do what is very commonly accomplished through mixed models, and allow for more complex models than typically seen for standard mixed models.  One's default should probably be to use the more common, and probably more flexible (in most situations), mixed modeling tools, where there are packages in R that could handle nonlinear effects, mediation and multivariate outcomes for mixed models. I have other documents regarding mixed models on my [website](https://m-clark.github.io/documents) and code at [GitHub](https://github.com/m-clark/Miscellaneous-R-Code). However, the latent variable approach may provide what you need, and at the very least gives you a fresh take on the standard mixed model perspective.


[^reml]: One can set REML=F so as to use standard maximum likelihood and make the results directly comparable to <span class="pack">lavaan</span>.

[^nonlinearfewtimepts]: I personally cannot *see* bends with only four time points, at least such that I couldn't just as easily posit a linear trend.

# Mixture Models

Thus far we have understood latent variables as possessing an underlying continuum, i.e. normally distributed with a mean of zero and some variance.  This does not have to be the case, and instead we can posit a categorical variable.  Some approaches you may be already familiar with, as any modeling process under the heading of 'cluster analysis' could be said to deal with latent categorical variables.  The issue is that we may feel that there is some underlying structure to the data that is described as discrete, and based on perhaps multiple variables.  

We will approach this in the way that has been done from statistical and related motivations, rather than the SEM/psychometric approach.  This will hopefully make clearer what it is we're dealing with, as well as not get bogged down in terminology.  Furthermore, mixture models are typically poorly implemented within SEM, as many of the typical issues found in such models can often be magnified.  The goal here as before is clarity of thought over 'being able to run it'.  

A common question in such analysis is *how many clusters*?  There are many, many techniques for answering this question, and not a single one of them even remotely definitive.  On the plus side, the good news is that we already know the answer, because the answer is always 1.  However, that won't stop us from trying to discover more than that, so here we go.


## A Motivating Example

Take a look at the following data. It regards the waiting time between eruptions and the duration of the eruption (both in minutes) for the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA.

```{r faithfulPlot, echo=F}
data("faithful")
library(plotly)
plot_ly(data=faithful, x=~eruptions, y=~waiting) %>% 
  lazerhawk::theme_plotly()
```

<br>
Take a good look.  This is probably the cleanest separation of clustered data you will likely ever see[^iris], and even so there are still data points that might fall into either cluster.

## Create Clustered Data

To get a sense of mixture models, let's actually create some data that might look like the Old Faithful data above. In the following we start by  creating something similar the eruptions variable in the faithful data. To do so, we draw one random sample from a normal distribution with a mean of 2, and the other with a mean of 4.5, and both get a standard deviation of .25.  The first plot is based on the code below, the second on the actual data.

```{r simFaithful, echo=-c(1,6:7)}
library(ggplot2)
set.seed(1234)
erupt1 = rnorm(150, mean=2, sd=.25)
erupt2 = rnorm(150, mean=4.5, sd=.25)
erupt = sample(c(erupt1, erupt2))
ggplot(aes(x=erupt), data=data.frame(erupt)) + geom_density() + lazerhawk::theme_trueMinimal()
ggplot(aes(x=eruptions), data=faithful) + geom_density() + lazerhawk::theme_trueMinimal()
```

What do we see here?  The data is a *mixture* of two normals, but we can think of the observations as belonging to a latent class, and each class has its own mean and standard deviation (and is based on a normal distribution here, but doesn't have to be).  Each observation has some likelihood, however great or small, of coming from either cluster, and had we really wanted to do more appropriate simulation, we would incorporate that information.

A basic approach for categorical latent variable analysis from a model based perspective[^cluster] could be seen as follows:

1. Posit the number of clusters you believe there to be
2. For each observation, estimate those probability of coming from either cluster
3. Assign observations to the most likely class (i.e. the one with the highest probability)

More advanced approaches might include:

- Predicting the latent classes with other covariates in a manner akin to logistic regression
- Allow your model coefficients to vary based on cluster membership
    - For example, have separate regression models for each class
- Use more recent techniques that will allow the number of clusters to grow with the data (non-SEM)

## Mixture modeling with Old Faithful

The following uses the <span class="pack">flexmix</span>  package and function to estimate a regression model for each latent class.  In this case, our model includes only an intercept, and so is equivalent to estimating the mean and variance of each group.  We posit `k=2` groups.

```{r flexmixEruptions, echo=-1}
set.seed(1234)
library(flexmix)
mod = flexmix(eruptions~1,  data=faithful, k = 2)
summary(mod)
```

We can see from the summary about 2/3 are classified to one group. We also get the estimated means and standard deviations for each group, as well as note respective probabilities of each observation for each class.  Note that the group labels are completely arbitrary.

```{r flexmixEruptions2, echo=-2}
parameters(mod)    # means (Intercept) and std dev (sigma) for each group
head(mod@posterior$scaled, 10) %>% round(4)  # show some estimated probabilities
```


The first of the next two plots shows the estimated probabilities for each observation for the clusters (with some jitter). Basically it shows that if that most are very highly probable of belonging to either class.  Again, you will probably never see anything like this, but clarity is useful here.  The second plot shows the original data with their classification and contours of the density for each group.


```{r eruptionsProbPlot, echo=F}
g = qplot(x=mod@posterior$scaled[,1], y=mod@posterior$scaled[,2]) + 
  geom_jitter(width=.05, height=.05, alpha=.1) + 
  xlab('Posterior Probablity for Group 1') +
  ylab('Posterior Probablity for Group 2') +
  lazerhawk::theme_trueMinimal() 
ggplotly(width=500)
```
```{r eruptionsContourPlot, echo=FALSE}
cluster = factor(mod@cluster)
g = qplot(data=faithful, x=eruptions, y=waiting, color=cluster) + 
    geom_density2d() +
  lazerhawk::theme_trueMinimal()
ggplotly(width=500)
```



## SEM and Latent Categorical Variables

Dealing with categorical latent variables can be somewhat problematic. Interpreting a single SEM model might be difficult enough, but then one might be allowing parts of it to change depending on which latent class observations belong to, while having to assess the latent class measurement model as well.  It can be difficult to find a clarity of understanding from this process, as one is discovering classes then immediately assuming key differences among these classes they didn't know existed beforehand[^latclass].  In addition, one will need even more data than standard SEM to deal with all the additional parameters that are allowed to vary across the classes.  

Researchers also tend to find classes that represent 'hi-lo' or 'hi-med-lo' groups, which may suggest they should have left the latent construct as a continuous variable. When given the choice to discretize continuous variables in normal settings, it is rare in which the answer is anything but a resounding *no*.  As such, one should think hard about the ultimate goals of such a model.  

Another issue I've seen in applied practice is that the the 'latent' classes uncovered are in fact intact classes representing an interaction of variables available in the data, or possibly some grouping variable that wasn't in the model.  It would be much more straightforward to use the standard interaction approach in a more guided fashion, as opposed to assuming *every* variable effect interacts with a latent variable.  In typical modeling scenarios such an option (i.e. laying waste to our model with interactions) is almost never considered, and even then we'd want some sort of regularizing approach[^factorMachine], which is non-existent in this SEM setting.

### Latent Categories vs. Multi-group Analysis

The primary difference between the latent class analysis and a multiple group approach is that in the latter, grouping structure explicitly exists in the data, for example, sex, race etc. In that case, a <span class="emph">multi-group analysis</span>, a.k.a. multi-sample analysis, would allow for separate SEM models per group.  In the latent categorical variable situation, one must first discover the latent groups. By contrast, in multi-group analysis, a common goal is to test <span class="emph">measurement invariance</span>, a concept which has several definitions itself.  An example would be to see if the latent structure holds for an American vs. foreign sample, with the same items for the scale provided in the respective languages. This makes a lot of sense from a measurement model perspective and has some obvious use.

If one wants to see a similar situation for a less practically driven model, e.g. to see if an SEM model is the same for males vs. females, this is equivalent to having an interaction with the sex variable for every path in the model.  The same holds for 'subgroup analysis' in typical settings, where you won't find any more than you would by including the interactions of interest with the whole sample, though you will certainly have less data to work with.  In any case, whether the classes are latent or intact, we need a lot of data to estimate parameters that are allowed to vary by group vs. a model in which they are fixed, and many simply do not have enough data for this.

### Latent Trajectories

As noted in the growth curve modeling section, these are growth curve models in which intercepts and slopes are allowed to vary across latent groups as well as the clusters.  The <span class="pack">flexmix</span> package used previously as well as others would allow one to estimate such models from the mixed model perspective, and might be preferred.

### Estimation

If you would like to see the conceptual innards of estimating mixture models using the <span class="emph">EM Algorithm</span>, see [this link](https://github.com/mclark--/Miscellaneous-R-Code/tree/master/ModelFitting/EM%20Examples) on my GitHub page.


### Terminology in SEM

Some unnecessary terminology comes into play from the SEM literature, such that it might be worth knowing about them so that one doesn't get out of sorts. SEM literature often makes the following distinctions:


```{r lcterminology, echo=FALSE}
# tab = "
# |    |      Ind Cat      |  Ind Cont |
# |----------|:-------------:|------:|
# | Lat Cat |  Latent Class | Latent Profile |
# | Lat Cont |    Latent Trait   |   Factor Analysis |
# "
tab = data_frame(`Indicator Categorical`=c('Latent Class', 'Latent Trait'),
                 `Indicator Continuous`=c('Latent Profile', 'Factor Analysis'))
rownames(tab) = c("Latent Categorical", 'Latent Continuous')
DT::datatable(tab, autoHideNavigation=T, options=list(paging=F, searching=F, ordering=F, info=F, columnDefs = list(list(className = 'dt-left', targets = 0:2))) )
```

Aside from noting whether the latent variable is categorical or not, these aren't very enlightening[^proftrait], and go back as far as the 60s. Back then perhaps it was useful, but in the end, it's all just 'latent variable analysis'.

Some other terminology includes:

<span class="emph">Mixture models</span> Refers generally to dealing with categorical latent variables as demonstrated above.

<span class="emph">Finite Mixture models</span> Same thing.

<span class="emph">Cluster analysis</span> Same thing.

<span class="emph">Latent Class Analysis</span> refers to dealing with categorical latent variables in the context of multivariate data, especially within the measurement model scenario.  For example one might have a series of yes/no questions on a survey, and want to discover categories of collections of responses.  Some use it for the specific case of categorical indicators, but this is not necessary.

<span class="emph">Latent Profile Analysis</span> refers to dealing with categorical latent variables in the context of multivariate numerical/continuous data. Again, most people outside of SEM would simply call this a mixture model.

<span class="emph">Latent Trait Analysis</span> refers to dealing with continuous latent variables in the context of multivariate categorical data. Again, most people outside of SEM would simply call this a mixture model, but it also serves as the setting for Item-Response Theory models where we, for example, find latent 'ability' among binary test items that are correct vs. not.


## R packages used
- <span class="pack">flexmix</span>




[^iris]: Outside of iris, which is also used regularly to give people unrealistic expectations about what to expect from their cluster analysis.

[^cluster]: Note that k-means and other common cluster analysis techniques are not model based as in this example.  In model-based approaches we assume some probabilistic data generating process (e.g. normal distribution) rather than some heuristic.

[^latclass]: By contrast, continuous latent variables are typically clearly theoretically motivated in typical SEM practice.  Typical SEM data set sizes would usually limit the number of groups to three or four at most, because the smallest latent group will be the limiting factor, but still needs enough data to run an SEM model confidently.  However, there is no reason to believe there would only be three distinct latent classes in any reasonable amount of data.

[^proftrait]: I can never keep profile vs. trait straight.

[^factorMachine]: See for example, Rendle (2010). Factorization machines. [link](https://www.ismll.uni-hildesheim.de/pub/pdfs/Rendle2010FM.pdf)

# Exercises
## Path Analysis
### Part 1

This exercise investigates satisfaction in high school seniors using the 1993 Monitoring the Future dataset (`'data/monitorfuture.csv'`). Perform a path analysis on the four measured variables: self-esteem (esteem), overall life satisfaction (overall), locus of control (locus), and loneliness (lonely). Estimate the following model using lavaan (note that the dashed line is an 'unanalyzed' correlation and doesn't need to be explicit in the model).

<br>

```{r paExercise1Old, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
mcclelland = haven::read_dta('data/path_analysis_data.dta')
library(lavaan)
modMath = 
"
  math21 ~ math7 + read7
  math7 ~ attention4
  read7 ~ attention4
"
math  = sem(modMath, data=mcclelland)
summary(math, rsquare=TRUE)
semPlot::semPaths(math, style='lisrel', rotation = 2, layout = 'tree2', intercepts = F)
```

```{r pa1, echo=FALSE}
mtf = read.csv('data/monitorfuture.csv')
satistifaction_ModelCode = '
  overall ~ esteem + lonely
  esteem ~ locus + lonely
'
satistifaction_ModelResults = sem(satistifaction_ModelCode, data=mtf)
semPlot::semPaths(satistifaction_ModelResults, residuals=F, style='lisrel', sizeMan=8,
                  edgeLabels='', residScale=10, nCharNodes=6, exoVar=F, rotation=2)
```

First get the data in, then set up your model code.  The following provides a hint.

```{r pa1Hint1, eval=FALSE, code.fold='hide'}
mtf = read.csv('filelocation/name.csv')

satistifaction_ModelCode = 'Y ~ X + z'
```

After that, run the model using the <span class="func">sem</span> function in <span class="package">lavaan</span>.  The following provides a hint.

```{r pa1Hint2,  eval=FALSE}
satistifaction_ModelResults = sem(modelcodename, data=modeldataname)

summary(satistifaction_ModelResults, rsquare=T)
```


Your results should be consistent with the following graph.

```{r paResults, echo=FALSE, results='hide', eval=-6}
satistifaction_ModelResults = sem(satistifaction_ModelCode, data=mtf)
summary(satistifaction_ModelResults, rsquare=T)

# to visualize
library(semPlot)
semPaths(satistifaction_ModelResults, whatLabels='est', style='lisrel', rotation=2)
```
```{r echo=FALSE}
# or color based on direction, fade with size, using standardized estimates
semPaths(satistifaction_ModelResults, what='std', style='lisrel', 
         layout='tree2', rotation=2, covAtResiduals=F, 
         sizeMan=10, edge.label.cex=1.5, color='#ff5503', borders=F, 
         label.color='#ffffff')
```


<br>

Questions:

1. What are the positive effects in this model?

2. What are the negative effects in this model?

3. What is your initial impression about model performance?

4. What specifically are the R^2^ values for the endogenous variables?


### Part 2

Rerun with the following model (click to show).

<br>

```{r mediationExercise, eval=FALSE}
satistifaction_ModelCode_Mediation = '
  overall ~ c*esteem + lonely
  esteem ~ a*locus + b*lonely

  # Indirect effects
  locusOverall := a*c
  lonelyOverall := b*c
'
```

<br>

Regarding this mediation model... 

  - A. Is the indirect effect for loneliness on life satisfaction statistically significant? 
  - B. How about locus of control?
  - C. Do you think loneliness causes self-esteem (more lonely, less self-esteem), or vice versa, or perhaps they are simply correlated?

<br><br><br>




## Factor Analysis

### Part 1

Data: National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1997, NLSY97), which investigates the transition from youth to adulthood. For this example, a series of questions asked to the participants in 2006 pertaining to the government’s role in promoting well-being will be investigated. Questions regarded the government's responsibility for following issues: provide jobs for everyone, keep prices under control, provide health care, provide for elderly, help industry, provide for unemployed, reduce income differences, provide college financial aid, provide decent housing, protect environment.  They have four values 1:4, which range from 'definitely should be' to 'definitely should not be'.


1. Run a factor analysis using the `'data/nlsy97_governmentNumeric.csv'` dataset.  Your first model will have all items (sans ID) loading on a single factor, with a name of your choosing.  With <span class="pack">lavaan</span>, use the <span class="func">cfa</span> function.  Recall that you give it the model code (as a <span class="objclass">string</span>) and a `data = ` argument like `cfa(mod, data=mydata)`.

Try it on your own or click to see the general format.

```{r fa1Starter, eval=FALSE}
govtInvolvement = read.csv('data/nlsy97_governmentNumeric.csv')
govtInvolvement_ModelCode = 'Your Model Here'
govtInvolvement_Results = cfa(govtInvolvement_ModelCode)
summary(govtInvolvement_Results, standardized=T, fit=T)
```

<br><br>

2. Note the standardized loadings, are the items 'hanging together' well?  Do you see any that might be we somewhat weak?



### Part 2

3. Now specify a two factor structure *of your choosing*. As an example, some of these are maybe more economic in nature, while others might fit in some other category.  Whatever makes sense to you, or just randomly split it.

4. Does this seem any more interpretable?  Were the latent variables notably correlated? Which model would you say is better based on internal performance, in terms of comparison (e.g. lower AIC = preferred model), and in terms of interpretability?


Click to show example (after you've tried yourself).
<br>

```{r fa2, eval=FALSE, bootstrap.show.code=F}
library(lavaan)
govtInvolvement = read.csv('data/nlsy97_governmentNumeric.csv')

govtInvolvement_ModelCode1 = "
  moregovt =~ ProvideJobs + Prices + HealthCare + Elderly + Industry + Unemployed + IncInequal + College + Housing + Environment
"
model1 = cfa(govtInvolvement_ModelCode1, data=govtInvolvement) 
summary(model1, fit=T, standardized=T)

govtInvolvement_ModelCode2 = '
  econ =~ ProvideJobs + Industry + Unemployed + IncInequal + Housing + Prices
  services =~ HealthCare + Elderly + College + Environment
'
model2 = cfa(govtInvolvement_ModelCode2, data=govtInvolvement) 
summary(model2, fit=T, standardized=T)

# Compare the two († means the better result)
semTools::compareFit(model1, model2, nested=F)
```


<br><br><br>

## SEM

You get the choice of doing exercise 1 or 2.

### Exercise 1

The data for this exercise comes from a paper published by Marsh and Hocevar in 1985. The data regards information on 385 fourth and fifth grade students who filled out a ‘Self-Description Questionnaire.’ The questionnaire has 16 items, four of which measure physical ability, four measure physical appearance, four measure relations with peers and the final four measure relations with parents. The data is saved in the file ‘Marsh85.dta’ as summary data with means, standard deviations and correlations.  However you will just use 'Marsh85_SEMExercise.csv', which is the covariance matrix.

We are interested in determining how a student’s physical appearance and physical ability might predict relationships with their peers. The diagram for the model of interest is shown below.

<br><br><br>

```{r sem1, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
marsh = haven::read_dta('data/Marsh85.dta')  # grade 1 and 2 are 4 and fifth, first two rows of each are the means and sd

marshCov = marsh %>%
  filter(grade==1) %>%
  select(contains('phyab'), contains('appear'), contains('peer')) %>%
  slice(-(1:2)) %>%
  slice(1:12) %>%
  data.matrix
rownames(marshCov) = colnames(marshCov)
meanssds =  marsh %>%  slice(1:2) %>% select(contains('phyab'), contains('appear'), contains('peer'))

marshCov = lavaan::cor2cov(R=marshCov, sds=unlist(meanssds[2,]))

# write.csv(marshCov, file='data/Marsh85_SEMExercise.csv', row.names=T)
marshCov = read.csv('data/Marsh85_SEMExercise.csv', row.names = 1)  
marshCov = as.matrix(marshCov)


peerRel_ModelCode = "
  # Measurement models
  Appearance =~ appear1 + appear2 + appear3 + appear4
  Ability =~ phyab1 + phyab2 + phyab3 + phyab4
  Relations =~ peerrel1 + peerrel2 + peerrel3 + peerrel4

  # Structural Models
  Relations ~ Ability + Appearance
"
library(lavaan)
peerRel_Results = sem(peerRel_ModelCode, sample.cov=marshCov, sample.nobs=385)
summary(peerRel_Results)
```

```{r sem1fig, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', dev='svg'}
# semPlot::semPaths(peerRel_Results, residuals=T, style='lisrel', edgeLabels='', 
#                   residScale=10, nCharNodes=6, exoVar=T, edge.label.cex=1)
semPlot::semPaths(peerRel_Results, layout='tree2', style='lisrel', covAtResiduals=F, residuals = T,
                  groups=c('latent', 'man'),  color=list(latent='#ff5503', man=scales::alpha('#ff5503',.5)),
                  sizeMan=5, sizeLat=10, edge.label.cex=1.5, borders=F, #edge.color='#1e90ff',
                  nCharNodes=6, exoVar=T,
                  label.color='#ffffff') 
```

<br>

The following will get you started. All you need to do is fill in the model code. Rather than raw data, we will be using the sample covariance matrix with sample size equal to 385. Note how you can detect the structure visually.  Physical ability hangs together well and is positively correlated with the other factors, which are more strongly correlated with each other.  This is extremely important in factor analysis and SEM, as they deal with the correlation matrix, you should often be able to see the structure before modeling even begins.



```{r corplot, echo=FALSE, eval=T, message=F, warning=F}
# corrplot::corrplot(cov2cor(marshCov), order='hclust', addrect=3, rect.col='#ff5503', tl.col='gray50')
suppressMessages(lazerhawk::corrheat(cov2cor(marshCov)))  # knitr won't ignore message otherwise
```

<br>

```{r sem1Starter, eval=FALSE}
marsh85 = read.csv('data/Marsh85_SEMExercise.csv', row.names = 1)
marsh85 = as.matrix(marsh85)
peerRel_ModelCode = ''
peerRel_Results = sem(peerRel_ModelCode, sample.cov=marsh85, sample.nobs=385)
summary(peerRel_Results, standardized=T, fit=T, rsquare=T)
```

<br><br>

> Write a brief summary in terms of an assessment of the measurement components of the model, overall impression of model fit, and specifics of the structural relations (i.e. the paths among the latent variables) and model performance in terms of R^2^.




### Exercise 2

In this second example, we will use the classic Political Democracy dataset used by Bollen in his seminal 1989 book on structural equation modeling. This data set includes four measures of democracy at two points in time, 1960 and 1965, and three measures of industrialization in 1960, for 75 developing countries.

- FoPress60: freedom of the press, 1960
- FoPopp60: freedom of political opposition, 1960
- FairElect60: fairness of elections, 1960
- EffectiveLeg60: effectiveness of elected legislature, 1960
- FoPress65: freedom of the press, 1965
- FoPopp65: freedom of political opposition, 1965
- FairElect65: fairness of elections, 1965
- EffectiveLeg65: effectiveness of elected legislature, 1965
- GNP60: GNP per capita, 1960
- EnConsump60: energy consumption per capita, 1960
- PercLaborForce60: percentage of labor force in industry, 1960

The model we wish to estimate is in according to the following diagram.

<br><br>

```{r sem2, echo=F}
poldem = read.csv('data/PoliticalDemocracy.csv')
poldem_ModelCode = '
  # measurement model
    ind60 =~ GNP60 + EnConsump60 + PercLaborForce60
    dem60 =~ FoPress60 + FoPopp60 + FairElect60 + EffectiveLeg60
    dem65 =~ FoPress65 + FoPopp65 + FairElect65 + EffectiveLeg65
  # regressions
    dem60 ~ ind60
    dem65 ~ ind60 + dem60
'
poldem_Results = sem(poldem_ModelCode, data=poldem)
semPlot::semPaths(poldem_Results, layout='tree2', style='lisrel', covAtResiduals=F, residuals = T,
                  groups=c('latent', 'man'),  color=list(latent='#ff5503', man=scales::alpha('#ff5503',.5)),
                  sizeMan=5, sizeLat=10, edge.label.cex=1.5, borders=F, #edge.color='#1e90ff',
                  nCharNodes=6, exoVar=T,
                  label.color='#ffffff') 
```

<br><br><br>

```{r corplotsem2, echo=FALSE, eval=F}
# corrplot::corrplot(cor(poldem), order='hclust', addrect=3, rect.col='#ff5503', tl.col='gray50')
lazerhawk::corrheat(cor(poldem))
```

<br><br>

Here is some starter code. All you need to do is fill in the model code.

<br><br>

```{r sem2Starter, eval=FALSE}
poldem = read.csv('data/PoliticalDemocracy.csv')
poldem_ModelCode = ''
poldem_Results = sem(poldem_ModelCode, data=poldem)
summary(poldem_Results, standardized=T, fit=T, rsquare=T)
```

### McClelland 

#### Description

- McClelland et al. (2013) abstract 

> This study examined relations between children's attention span-persistence in preschool and later school achievement and college completion. Children were drawn from the Colorado Adoption Project using adopted and non-adopted children (N = 430). Results of structural equation modeling indicated that children's age 4 attention span-persistence significantly predicted math and reading achievement at age 21 after controlling for achievement levels at age 7, adopted status, child vocabulary skills, gender, and maternal education level. Relations between attention span-persistence and later achievement were not fully mediated by age 7 achievement levels. Logistic regressions also revealed that age 4 attention span-persistence skills significantly predicted the odds of completing college by age 25. The majority of this relationship was direct and was not significantly mediated by math or reading skills at age 7 or age 21. Specifically, children who were rated one standard deviation higher on attention span-persistence at age 4 had 48.7% greater odds of completing college by age 25. Discussion focuses on the importance of children's early attention span-persistence for later school achievement and educational attainment.

### National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (1997, NLSY97)

#### Description

NLSY97 consists of a nationally representative sample of approximately 9,000 youths who were 12 to 16 years old as of December 31, 1996. Round 1 of the survey took place in 1997. In that round, both the eligible youth and one of that youth's parents received hour-long personal interviews. In addition, during the screening process, an extensive two-part questionnaire was administered that listed and gathered demographic information on members of the youth's household and on his or her immediate family members living elsewhere. Youths are interviewed on an annual basis. 

The NLSY97 is designed to document the transition from school to work and into adulthood. It collects extensive information about youths' labor market behavior and educational experiences over time. Employment information focuses on two types of jobs, "employee" jobs where youths work for a particular employer, and "freelance" jobs such as lawn mowing and babysitting. These distinctions will enable researchers to study effects of very early employment among youths. Employment data include start and stop dates of jobs, occupation, industry, hours, earnings, job search, and benefits. Measures of work experience, tenure with an employer, and employer transitions can also be obtained. Educational data include youths' schooling history, performance on standardized tests, course of study, the timing and types of degrees, and a detailed account of progression through post-secondary schooling.

### Old Faithful

#### From the R helpfile

Waiting time between eruptions and the duration of the eruption for the Old Faithful geyser in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, USA. A closer look at faithful$eruptions reveals that these are heavily rounded times originally in seconds, where multiples of 5 are more frequent than expected under non-human measurement. For a better version of the eruption times, see the example below.

There are many versions of this dataset around: Azzalini and Bowman (1990) use a more complete version.

## Terminology in SEM

SEM as it is known has been widely used in psychology and education for decades, while other disciplines have developed and advanced techniques that are related, but would not typically call them SEM.  The following will be expanded over time.

**Latent variable**: an unobserved or hidden variable.  It's specific interpretation will depend on the modeling context.

**Factor Analysis**: in the SEM literature, this refers to a latent variable (measurement) model to assess the underlying construct behind the correlations among a set of observed variables.  Elsewhere it may refer to a very broad family of matrix factorization techniques that would include things like principal components analysis, non-negative matrix factorization, etc.

**Exploratory vs. Confirmatory**: This distinction is problematic.  Science and data analysis is inherently exploratory, and most who use SEM do some model exploration as they would with any other model.  Some SEM models have more constraints than others, but that does not require a separate name or way of thinking about the model.

**Mediation** and moderation:  These mean different things, both straightforward, and which is utilized in a model should be based on theoretical notions.

- Mediation: an indirect effect, e.g. A->B->C, A has an indirect effect on C. A can have a direct effect on C too. 
- Moderation: an interaction (the same ones utilized in a standard regression modeling)

**Fit**: Model fit is something very difficult to ascertain in SEM, and notoriously problematic in this setting, where all proposed cutoffs for a good fit are ultimately arbitrary.  Even if one had most fit indices suggesting a 'good' fit, there's little indication the model has predictive capability.

**Endo/Exogenous**: Endogenous variables are determined by other variables, exogenous variables have no analyzed causes.

**Disturbance**: residual variance. Includes measurement error and unknown causes.

**Mixture Models**: models using categorical latent variables.

## Parallel Process Example

```{r parallelProcess, eval=FALSE}

# parallel process --------------------------------------------------------

# let's simulate data with a negative slope average and positive correlation among intercepts and other process slopes
set.seed(1234)
n = 500
timepoints = 4
time = rep(0:3, times=n)
subject = rep(1:n, each=4)

# first we'll draw intercepts with overall mean .5 and -.5 for the two
# processes, and let them have a slight correlation. Their variance is 1.
intCorr = matrix(c(1,.2,.2,1), ncol=2) 
colnames(intCorr) = rownames(intCorr) = c('i1', 'i2')
intCorr

interceptP1 = .5
interceptP2 = -.5

ranInts = MASS::mvrnorm(n, mu=c(0,0), Sigma = intCorr, empirical=T)
ranInts = data.frame(ranInts)
head(ranInts)
cor(ranInts)
colMeans(ranInts)

# now create slopes with intercept/mean .4, -.4, but the same positive
# relationship with their respective intercept. Their variances are also 1.
slopeP1 = .4
slopeP2 = -.4

s1 = .3*ranInts$i2  + rnorm(n)
s2 = .3*ranInts$i1  + rnorm(n)

ranef = data.frame(ranInts, s1, s2)
head(ranef)

## Causal Bias

> Consider what effects, that might conceivably have practical bearings, we conceive the object of our conception to have. Then, our conception of these effects is the whole of our conception of the object. 

I figure I should note my stance on soi-disant *causal modeling* so that whatever I might say in this document is taken with the appropriate context. What follows is more or less a philosophical stance, perhaps a naïve and definitely not very well developed one at that despite my philosophy background from long ago, but one that I think is a safer perspective than others commonly held regarding causes and statistics.  Mostly this is just me jotting down some things I'm thinking about while working on this document, and perhaps I'll be able to spend more time with it later.

To begin, no statistical model *by itself* will ever provide evidence of causal effects. This is a fact that cannot be disputed.  Statistical models of the sort we are usually interested in are inherently probabilistic, atheoretical in and of themselves, and wholly dependent on the data collected. No amount of fancy analysis or double-blind randomization will change the fact that in the end you have a probabilistic result, and one that is highly dependent on many assumptions both statistical and theoretical, as well as nuances of the data.  The data itself might suggest several statistical models that are essentially if not exactly equally adequate.  If you are using SEM or other approach to *discover* causal effects you will thus be unsuccessful, and as such, you should not be using the technique if that is the primary reason for doing so.

Philosophically speaking, I also don't think the methods of scientific analysis, i.e. statistics, can be used to *prove* causal relations, and more so if one considers that we've been debating the nature of causality for thousands of years and have yet to come to a conclusion about its definition that everyone can agree on.  Such bold 'proof-like' and 'causal' claims, consistently shown to be wrong because they *must be* in order to be a scientific claim in the first place, have much to do with undermining public faith in scientific results.  However, if we can't entirely agree on what constitutes a causal relation in the first place, we definitely can't hope that there is some magical statistical technique that would help us determine it.

As an example, available data should not convince you that smoking causes lung cancer, and that is because it doesn't.  If it did, everyone who ever smoked would have lung cancer.  This is a *deterministic* notion of causality, and there are others, but it is the one I think is used in everyday parlance. Using a *probabilistic* interpretation instead, e.g. a smoker is more likely to have cancer, just serves to emphasize the uncertainty that exists in the underlying model.  I'm perfectly okay with this, but many seem uncomfortable with any lack of certainty.  I might even say that smoking has an 'effect' on the likelihood of getting lung cancer[^afrsmoke]. In the end, all we have in the data are those that have lung cancer or not, and there is no uncertainty about them having it, nor does our knowledge of their smoking habits change the fact of whether they do.

As another example, you can randomly assign people who have cancer to two groups- in one they take an aspirin every day, in the other they drink orange juice every day. You may then find that they are equally effective in terms of remission rates, but it would be silly to think the 'treatments' had any causal effect at all, even though the effects could be non-zero statistically. Randomization, which is assumed by many to have the magical ability to confer causality on a scientific endeavor, doesn't help the situation either.  In fact, it could be said that *control* is the key element in determining causal relations (a claim that like others is not without issue), and the random nature of assignment actually undermines that.  

Modern health science is not removed from this issue, or even far removed from this example, and regularly finds 'effects' of drugs or behavior that have no causal relation to the phenomenon under study. This is especially the case with psychological phenomena, many of which to this day still have little or no tie to operational definitions based on physiology rather than behavior.  People even go so far as to ascribe an actual causal effect to nothing at all (placebo effect).

I personally think it's somewhat misguided to think that a major goal of (at least most of working) science is to establish formal causal relations.  Its primary tool for weighing evidence, i.e. statistical modeling, certainly cannot do that. As much as we want control, which is one thing that could potentially establish causality, it eludes us, and problematically seems to beg for a human element to causality besides.  *Ceteris peribus* can only work for what is included in our models.  Furthermore, if we actually knew the cause of something, we definitely would not need a statistical model.  On the practical side, few seem to be engaging in science for reasons of determining causal effects (except perhaps in the discussion sections of papers), and rather do so to discover new potential explanations and predict something better than we did before.


### Prediction

A well-worn data set on which to test classification algorithms is the [MNIST hand written digits data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database).  The methods use the pixel gray-scale information to classify an image of what are originally handwritten digits as being one of the values 0-9.  Modern approaches can get accurate classification *on test data* with less than 1% error.  If one's goal is to understand why the digits are the way they are, this model cannot help you. And yet, a statistical approach can be very successful while still having nothing to say about the causal mechanisms influencing the target variable we wish to speak about. 

If you can predict something with 99% accuracy, how much are you concerned about the underlying causal reality? But this is in fact what I think is the primary *practical* goal of scientific endeavor, i.e. accurate prediction. It definitely is not about 'true' parameters and p-values.  The models are wrong, but they can work, and we'd prefer those that work better. That is something science can provide.  Models can even correspond to 'reality' as we currently know it, but we all know that knowledge of reality changes as well, often due to science scientific discoveries. Peirce figured this out long ago. I'd personally rather have something that works than have one of the 'true causes' and a model that leaves me no better than guessing.  Now let's say you have a 'causal' model and another model that uses other covariates, and yet they both predict equally well. What would be the basis for preferring one over the other? I think we'd all prefer the causal model, but what would tangibly be gained in the preference?


### Chance

Another related point, *chance* definitely does not cause anything. There are mechanisms you do not know about contributing to the variability in the subject matter under study, but nothing from your results are *due to chance*.  Statistical models will always have uncertainty regarding them, and how much or how little there is depends on many things.  But just because we don't know what's going on, we cannot put the unknown as due to some magical notion akin to coincidence.

### Other

- There are people, who have been taken seriously in other contexts, actively devoting time, money and energy to determine a. that our current existence is a simulation, and b. to find a way to 'break out of it' (I suspect this has to do with them taking their experience at Burning Man too seriously).  However useless an endeavor this may be, if it was a simulation, where would any theory about causality reside then?

- An interesting point noted by Pearl is that causal assumptions are not encoded via the paths/edges, which only note possible causal relations, but in the missing ones.  This reminds me of a chapter of the *Tao Te Ching*, that talks about the effectiveness of nothingness.  An example being that it is not the walls or physical aspects of a house, but the rooms, i.e. spaces, that make it an effective home.

### Some references

Practically anything by **Judea Pearl**, even though some of the above might seem like I'm entirely missing many of the points he tries to make.  On the contrary, I actually find it hard to disagree with Pearl, I just prefer to focus on the practical aspects of modeling, which in the end includes a statistical model that can exist independently of any causal notion, and on ways of improving such models.  He is very clear however, that structural models rest on untestable assumptions and statistical results.

The quote at the beginning is by **C.S. Peirce**.  I note it because I am more interested in clear ideas, without which one cannot hope to even begin to understand causal relations, however defined.  The notion of a thing intimately entails *all* of its *practical effects*.  In other words, my definition of you must include how you are potentially able to act upon the universe, and in fact, my definition of you *is* what practical effects you have on the universe.  The lack of clear ideas in scientific research is a fundamental problem too often ignored.
