# Other


These are other topics that may be covered in varying detail in the future. With possible packages noted. They are roughly in order of importance to me/what I think would be good for this document.


- IRT
    - ltm or lavaan
- Mixture models (here as I have some things that could be used somewhat easily) 
    - Dirichlet process example, discuss zero-inflated models, and possibly add other content.
- Collaborative filtering
    - recommenderlab
- Multiple group analysis
    - via lavaan
    
    *Hope you have a lot of data.*

    Multigroup (also multi-sample, multiple sample etc.) analysis is, as its name implies, engaging SEM across multiple *intact* groups. I say intact to distinguish the mixture models from before, where the categories are latent.  As an example, we could compare 
    
    Measurement invariance
    
    - Configural
    - Weak
    - Strong
    - Strict
    
    Other:
    
    - Longitudinal Stability

- Multilevel SEM

- HMM, Linear Dynamical Systems
    - HMM, HiddenMarkov depmixS4
- Others


Extensions to current content that might be added in the future:

- To SEM chapter: regression with latent variables comparison
- To Growth chapter: why not to do cross-lagged models.
- To Appendix: cfa via ML R code.
